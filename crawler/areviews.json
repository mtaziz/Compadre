We took it off our watch list. Then I heard some good comments on the show. We decided to get the series and check it out. Glad that we did. Never saw that coming. It is Sci-Fi and it fits with the comic books I read as a child back in the 50's and 60's. The scripts are well thought out and filmed. For the most part the acting is okay, and the characters work surprisingly well together. I certainly am looking forward to season 3.",

I have watched in over 40 years, and so much better than 95% of all the movies I have gone to in the theaters in my life time. The directors and producers did a far more admirable job than Walking Dead or The 100, or anything else out there in the world, but those are still great shows.

I can't help but feel that the 1st Season suffered slightly as it waited for some major events to occur in Captain America: The Winter Soldier before its true story arc picked up. Once those events occurred Agents of Shield was truly allowed to shine. Joss Whedon's brilliance is peppered throughtout and the second season has finally put the show where Marvel fans have wanted it to be since its announcement.",

I had the advantage of sitting down and \"binge-watching\" the entire first half of the season on on Friday night.  (I ended up going to bed at 4 am!)

There's enough kick-butt action to please fans who enjoy it while still having plenty of character fleshing out to please those of us who love that.  The women of Agents really shine this time around - while Coulson's dry humor still hits home and Ward, Tripp and Fitz all have their moments, it's May, Simmons, Morse and Skye that are kicking some serious Hydra posterior this time around.  Skye's been learning some killer techniques from May, her SO.  May's still juggling her worries about Coulson while taking no prisoner.  Simmons is off doing something that will totally surprise you at first, them make complete sense the next moment.  And Morse is a great introduction to the cast, as is Ace, the new tech guy.  All in all, well worth spending your time on.  The writers and Whedon are giving Marvel fans a sweet, sweet ride this season (one almost as cool as Lola!)",

Since the outcome is nearly certain, the only reason to show the fight is that some people must get a vicarious thrill from seing a woman beating on a man.  If you want the fight to accomplish something plotwise, you need to have a woman fighting another woman because the outcome isn't predetermined.  In theory, I guess there are ways of getting around this, like having a female fighter trip and knock herself out or have an old man sneak up behind her and hit her in the head with a  vase... But, from a creative standpoint, girl power is a plot killer and its kitschy feminist appeal should relegate shows that rely on it to the Oxygen Channel, right next to Xena and Buffy.  What's wrong with having a female character act feminine?!  I wonder how much hate mail HBO got because they dared to show an actual feminine character in Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones!",

Hydra is out there and on the loose.  There are multiple shades of evil out there, from the extreme of Whitehall looking to achieve nothing more than Hydra's and his own agenda, to a more nuanced Ward character (still morally-corrupt, but in love with Sky) and Sky's father Cal Hyde.  IMO, Kyle MacLachlan's addition as Cal Hyde has been great for this season -- every scene he's in carries weight and is riveting to watch.  We've also been immersed more in Marvel's world since \"Winter Soldier\" -- Hydra's been more prevalent, a few Marvel characters like Crusher Creel and the Kree/Inhumans at the end.  These are all awesome developments.  Character development has grown as well, not only between FitzSimmons, from Coulson and with Maggie May, but also the constant interplay between Hunter and Bobbi Morse is always entertaining and often hilarious, any scene the aforementioned Cal Hyde is in, and even Raina's character has become a shade more nuanced.  Overall, a good show with a lot of promise has become a very good show with the promise of greatness.",

The one episode where the action really worked was the one with May vs. Evil May with the closed-corridor fighting that extended back into the room -- that was fast paced and expressive.  Very well done.  Season finale for example -- a little bland and boring.  Also, some characters haven't been that developed yet, which granted, is tough with how many characters they are adding to this show.

In the wake of season 1, they all become different, less guided-by-higher-standards (than the villains) people. A large part of what I enjoyed about season 1 has disappeared in the process.  Season 2 has been more graphically violent, and less is left to the imagination.  Coulson and the remnants of his team seem to be crumbling under pressure.  They're becoming less and less easy to distinguish from the psycho-villains they're combating.  The humor and human-ness has more or less been leached out of the story, leaving behind pure comic-book stuff.  Not an improvement.  I doubt I'll even look for season 3, if things continue in this vein.",

There is an underlying mystery that keeps one guessing. The casting is very good and the characters are very appealing. Even if you're in the Downton Abbey/BBC crowd (which I am as well) I'd give this a try. Once one dispenses with one's elitist prejudice it's quite diverting and entertaining.

I do not feel like this is a DC Comics/WB Beverley Hills 90210 \"comics show\", which they DC has let happen over and over again. AOS also requires some intelligence to catch everything, while you do not have to know all the Marvel lore.

I thought it was a fluke so we tried again.  It continues to freeze up.  Then we restarted from the beginning.  We try to fast forward to where we were and it freezes.  We don't have problems with any of our other Amazon videos, whether free or purchased, so something is WRONG WITH THIS episode.  How the heck do you contact Amazon about your digital orders?

In this second season I miss that Skye doesn't do all the computer stuff she did before, that makes more sense than her all of a sudden learning how to fight, which should (in reality) take many years of training. I like the agent Triplett character better than Ward ever was. I hope they kill Ward and drop the character altogether and move on. The new team is some of the old, and some of the new, and Fitz is a little of both. We'll see how he pans out during the season, but I hope they keep him on board. The Agent May character is as good as ever, though I wish they would quit messing with her makeup, not that she needs any. Maybe that's the point.",
