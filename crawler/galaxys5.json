At first I wasn't thrilled about the magazine, news feed on the home screen but if you don't like it, there is an option to turn it off. The personalization on this phone are great for my needs! Another great point is the motion controls! Let's say your phone is ringing and you want to shut it up without touching it. Well, Samsung made it so that you can turn on an option to turn your phone over to make the noise stop. My favorite feature on the phone is the camera! I LOVE THE SAMSUNG CAMERA!! Samsung really hit it on the nail with this one. One of the major reasons I chose this phone! From the selective focus option, HDR, different modes, and most of all the Samsung editing studio. Fire up your video and you'll have pre-loaded customizable themes you can use with music and lots of filters! I love it.",

I love the expandable memory on the S5, which I understand the S6 does not have. I am still not ready to put everything on a cloud, so the micro SD card is still my preference. I am happy with the Verizon service, even though the Straight Talk phone used Verizon lines. There is just no comparison in the improved service of the post pay 4G Verizon plan. My new S5 works mostly off my Wi-Fi, so I was able to get a very affordable plan by only paying for the data I will use. So far the minimal data is way more than I use and is affordable. The camera on the S5 is phenomenal! Once again, I found the best  deal on Amazon. Just a note of caution: I did have some minor trouble getting my old number transferred and the young Verizon salesman was really not wiling to help because he did not sell me the phone. It worked out well though, because the Amazon staff WAS able to resolve the problem. The little technical glitch was WELL worth the money I saved, and probably would not even have occurred if I had not been trying to transfer the number from Straight Talk which does NOT have the best technical support.",

Also in terms of pixel density this is one of the better phones on the market, according to Justafax.com/phones it has more dense pixels than the iphone6. Overall I\u2019d say if you know what you want, then this could be a great phone for you, but it\u2019s worth comparing all the phones side-by-side first to get a good understanding of what each have to offer.",

Verizon appears to continue to push a ton of BLOATware to their new customers - dozens of apps you don't need and you don't want, that crap up your phone and do not reliably inter-operate with Google apps.  If you don't switch to their apps, you're constantly hounded.  And their apps are inferior to others out there.  There's no simple way to migrate from the S3 without losing a bunch of apps and data that don't transfer for some reason - so it took me a whole day to try and get my new phone loaded with some of the data and apps that were on my old phone - the last transition wasn't nearly as painful.  I'm still seeing all kinds of problems with things like custom notifications?  Forget about it.. while you can add custom ringtones off the SD card, you can't do this with SMS notifications - this is incredibly annoying.  You can try copying files to certain directories but maybe they'll work for a little bit, and then the new custom notifications disappear and are no longer available - makes no sense.  The hardware appears to be top notch, but the software for this new iteration SUCKS.  I'm about to switch from Verizon I'm so tired of having to waste my time cleaning out their crappy, buggy software.",

The apps are also a little different.  I miss Motorola's tiny email preview app (Samsung's takes up a whole page) and its tiny calendar preview app (Samsung's app uses 1/4 page, horizontally); the apps on the Motorola both fit easily on Motorola's front page with room to spare.  Samsung, by contrast, uses a full half page for the front page app that shows time, date, weather, etc, leaving room only for 4 small app icons plus 4 core app icons.  Was excited to have fingerprint unlock capability--until it didn't recognize my fingerprint after umpteen swipes.  And I miss being able to mute the phone with a simple swipe while unlocked; the Samsung, by contrast, requires me to turn on the phone, unlock it and push the volume button down.

The battery would be completely drained not four hours after being fully charged. I would get text messages days after they were sent to me or often times not at all. I would have constant issues with the storage on the phone. I was told that I couldn't even update my applications, that there wasn't enough room. I knew for a fact that there was plenty of space on the hardware as well as on my memory card. I have contacted Samsung multiple times about these issues and none of their suggestions have worked for me. They advised me to send the phone to them so they could physically troubleshoot it. That is unacceptable. What am I supposed to do for a phone while they tinker with it and later charge me? I have given up hope on Samsung and have already order my new phone, the Motorola Nexus 6.

Amazon's customer service is the best on the planet, and 2nd to none. The rep was very understanding, and gave 1000% of effort to help me. The new phone arrived very quickly, and has worked well since. The key here is NOT to upgrade to Android 5.0 Lollipop until all of the bugs are fixed by Samsung and Google. However, I will say this; I own the copper colored S5 and I did upgrade to Lollipop 5.0 as soon asd it became available. My phone works flawlessly, and the battery drainage problems that everyone talks about, doesn't exist on my phone. On a full charge with heavy usage all day long for 12 hours, I still have 75% at days end. It doesn't get any better than that. No SD card problems, No WI-Fi problems, No Bluetooth issues or performance issues. I run Bluetooth all day, and I run \"Space HD\" Live Wallpaper.

I knew I was going with android for my next device and per the reviews the GS5 was the best one available. It's got great graphics and I like the size a lot. I love the fact that it's water resistant, it helps me breathe easier when I'm using it around water. A few cons now. The battery life is not good, I have fairly good charging habits, I wait until the battery is close to dead before I charge it again. But it's not that simple anymore. After one day at school with my phone on ultra power saving mode for most of the time, I come home around 3:30 with the battery at 40%. The battery is way too small for the size and power of the phone, so I recommend getting an extra battery with an external charger so you can just swap batteries whenever you need. The battery life is so frustrating that I have to give this 3 stars. If I could go back I'd still get this phone because I don't like the LG G3's button placement and I dislike the Nexus's lack of an SD card slot. It's a good phone, but I would highly recommend  an extra battery",

The phone arrived really quickly, and I love that I only had to pay $100 to upgrade to this (I had an iPhone 4S previously). I really missed the Swype option that I was used to before trying out Apple, so it's nice to have that again. Only complaints I have are that there is a LOT of bloatware on the s5, with no foreseeable way to delete it off your phone. But it keeps trying to update itself even though I've disabled it. And disabling certain pre-installed apps can interfere with the phone's ability to work properly. Also, I can't really adjust the home and lock screens without a lot of the picture getting cut out, and autocorrect overshoots the mark often. So that's kind of obnoxious. Other than that, really happy with the s5. Glad I made the switch back to an Android. The camera takes beautiful photos, and has a lot of neat little built in photo editing bells and whistles. Wouldn't trade it for anything else.",

Well once the phones got here and we had them activated I started receiving text messages that we were running out of data. How could that be and we have 30gigs?

The iPhone 6 appears to take better photos and video stabilization on the iPhone is better. The S5's camera functions are not as user friendly as the iPhone 6's. The S5's fingerprint scanner is more of a pain than a desirable feature. Disabled the fingerprint scanner after a week of use. Enabled the face recognition feature that is supposed to keep the display on as long as the phone detects you are looking at the screen but have yet to figure out how to make it work properly. Battery life is awesome. Lot of apps that come with the phone that cannot be uninstalled. Good phone but it has its quirks that can be frustrating until you get used to them.

After hearing all the hype about \"the switch\", and how easy it is, it looks like a bait-and-switch to me. There doesn't appear to be any non-pay service that allows you to bring over playlists, and the only way to bring your music over is to drag and drop. As somebody with an iTunes library of over 100 GB, this is ridiculous for me to sort through. Sadly, I will likely continue using my iPod touch as a companion to my S5, which I find to be a pathetic comprimise I have to make. As somebody who like to listen to music, I have a hard time recommending this phone.",

First of all I have compared this phone to everything out there, but I didn't know to compare it to the S5 models that are available.  Here is the reason for two stars, It would be Five Stars if it had more than 16GB internal memory.  I only have a few apps, I bought a 64 GB mini SD Card for music and photo storage not realizing it will take up 128 GB card.  Go ahead and get the 128 mini SD card (External Memory).  The phone wants to update software (internal Memory) as it needs to, but it says not enough space on internal memory.  So I started checking out the problem because again I don't have that many apps., what I discovered was I should have bought or held out for the 32 or 64 GB internal memory model that some carriers don't carry yet.

The difference, however, between the two phones is most apparent in the display:  full 1080p resolution with amazingly vibrant colors.  While the construction is largely plastic, that is not entirely a bad thing.  The phone is very light in the hand, yet tough enough to withstand reasonable falls without shattering to bits, unlike the iPhone.  Android as a platform is also incredibly customizable.  You can set up your phone exactly to your own preferences, not some designer's notion of what they should be.  This is truly a great phone at an amazing price.",

However, at school (a large university) my battery life takes a nose dive while on wifi. A tl;dr explanation of what is happening is that the android operating system has a bug where busy wifi networks are able to wake your phone up while it is sleeping (keyword: wake locks). This means your phone cannot go into a consistent \"deep sleep\" after you lock your phone and it will continue to drain your battery even when you're not using it. Feel free to google it for more info, but as of now, there is no fix. A quick fix for me was to download an app called MacroDroid. I set it so that when I am connected to my university network and I lock the screen, it will automatically shut the wifi off. When I turn the screen back on, the wifi is turned on automatically.

I'm pretty much stuck with AT&T where I live and travel to, so when my contract ran out and the Samsung S2 phones we had were acting up, I went looking for upgrades. I couldn't find any decent deals through ATT' s own web site so I went to a local store and saw the Fire phone. It was totally awesome but I had some reservations because it was new and had some bad press. I decided to go on Amazon to read more.finally was just about ready to buy two, when I clicked  on something by accident and found new Samsung Galaxy S5  for a little over $40. After happy dance, I went through the process and to my surprise, I could keep my old plan which was cheaper than the new bundles because of low data  allowances .. Most of ours is through wifi so no biggie. This is the phone to get....and buy Amazon for best deals.",

In terms or user-friendliness I feel that Samsung has improved greatly as well. Everything is set up on this phone in an orderly manner that makes things easy to find and use which is awesome, especially if you are a first time Android user. Lastly, the amount of customizationa available for this phone is amazing! Users can set their phones to talk to them, use Google as you would Siri for Apple, and customice greetings as well.

Fantastic screen, superb performance, great camera and the OS has come a long way since the first Droid days. If these things were the only things to review it would be a 5 star rating from me. However, more important than the phone are the available applications that you can run on the phone. This is where this and ANY other Android phone falls short. It becomes an amazingly frustrating exercise using an Android phone when the applications are total garbage. It's a shame because this aspect of the Android experience is what makes you want to throw the phone on the floor and smash it. Apple may have a restrictive policy when it comes to developing and publishing apps, but I see why Apple has a tighter grip on what apps are approved and published. In the end the phone, whether it be an S5, Droid or an iPhone, will ultimately be rated and reviewed on the application experience and not the phone itself. I have both this S5 and an iPhone and this S5 is in my opinion a better phone. Far better screen, customizable experience, better camera, etc. etc. But it becomes so frustrating using apps on the S5 that I find myself no longer wanting to use it. When applications crash, freeze, or just don't work as they should, you end up blaming the phone and you begin to throw out expletives condemning the phone and not the application. This aspect needs to be improved. If an app is garbage it makes the phone look like garbage and now I find myself wanting to replace it with an iPhone. It's a shame.",

Love the long lasting battery, the ease of use, the super easy syncing and bluetooth recognition, the toolbox feature, the beautiful, vivid resolution of the screen, and the 16mp camera. I've never been a fan of stock launchers, and this one was no different. So I quickly installed Apex, which is by far my favorite. It works very smoothly with this phone, I haven't tested the water proof feature yet, so I can't speak to that. But overall, I definitely think this is the best phone I've owned so far!",

This will not be a problem for many people but for anyone who carries the phone in their pocket (or anywhere else that the button might be pressed) this \"feature\" will cause major headaches. Once the screen has been activated just about anything can happen as the screen is now being \"touched\" by your pocket (and the warm body part below). Many people have reported multiple calls to 911. Any app might be activated -- the Pandora app on my phone was regularly being activated. This destroys the excellent battery life that this phone has.

So far the water resistance has worked as advertised. The only drawback I can think of is the same drawback as most nice phones like this,the storage, when you have the new nice shiny phone you immediately want to try out as much as you can on it and this tends to fill the storage up quickly. Luckily this can be remedied pretty easily by installing a microsd card into the back. It supports up any card up to 128 GB. So far everything it the phone is working great.

I've only had to use this mode once when my battery was at 2% and I just needed to make sure I had enough power to make a phone call when I got off the subway, and sure enough an hour later the phone was still on and I was able to place that call.",

This would have been OK but for two problems the first is the phone price dropped to $1 the day after I purchased it and I had to spend an hour convincing Amazon customer service to honor that price- luckily a discussion with a supervisor did the trick. The other problem is that Verizon charges a mysterious \"Upgrade Fee\" of $35 for what I don't really know. My service was already 4G before buying the phone and after a few calls to Verizon  they still can't explain what exactly is going on- but for some reason they know it is correct ;( One more thing, the upgrade fee is charged for any phone no matter where it is purchased- wife bought an apple phone at a Verizon store and the same junk fee showed up.",

These weren't essential, but were fun word games like Bookworm. I also don't like what apps you can get like Angry Birds, on the S5 they have advertisements thru the whole game. I'm told it's just with Android, and same with the permissions, I understand that different games need to know if a call is in progress in order to start working, but it doesn't need to analyze your call log. It seems as though apps are a bit more intrusive. I don't game all that much, and when I do, it's from my console, so this \"con\" if you can even call it that doesn't even bother me.

All of my music, contacts, notes, etc., was copied over to my S5 quick and easy. Yes, there is some issues with Android Kitkat not permitting third party apps not being able to write to the SD expansion card, but the Samsung \"My Files\" app makes it easy to get around that limitation without rooting the phone. Many apps can still be stored on the SD card saving device memory. The choices you get and the versatility you get with the Android makes this phone a much better option than buying an iPhone. I recently purchased a usb slave cable which makes let's the S5 use an external keyboard, hard drive, or flash drive with ease and I love the added capacity for file handling.

I really like the waterproof feature as I have killed a couple of phones in the past to water damage. My old Epic suffered minor water damage on a few occasions but always seemed to work again in the end. Samsung made a well sturdy phone with a lot of features. This phone is guaranteed to stay working even if you were to drop it in the sink as long as you have the back cover and charging port cover tightly closed. With the quad core cpu I do more now in less time with fewer reboots or lock-ups. Keep in mind it has a fm radio, fingerprint scanner for screen unlocking as well as so many other features as I'm still learning it. There is no paper manual but you can download it from the web. This is also a sim card phone, and if I understand sim phones, this one can be used with any carrier just by swapping the sim card. There is no sdcard installed but it will take a 128gb sdcard, I took the 16gb out of my Epic so I would have the extra space until I am able to get a bigger card. If you used foxfi or pdanet for a hotspot program like I did in my Epic, this phone will only work in Bluetooth and usb modes (wireless tested but no connect) but it will give you 4G-LTE speeds, which is faster than dsl, but about half as fast as cable. Highly recommended for those wishing to upgrade to the best that money can buy. Make sure you pair this with a good case and I recommend a tempered glass type screen protector as well.",

I had resisted that move for several years, thinking that my Verizon phone bill would increase by another $40-50 over the $105 which I was already paying for their base plan. Stopping by Verizon to troubleshoot a minor malfunction of my LG dumb phone, I asked how much an upgrade phone would cost me and was shocked to find out that my total phone bill would drop to $60 per month by switching to a smart phone. Wow. No brainer and took the plunge.",

Also took shots of family around a campfire and they came out just as the eye would see them. Not grainy and good detail. My biggest complaint about the camera is the inability to capture images of children moving. They blur. I wish there was a manual \"high shutter speed\" option to override the auto function. If there is, I have not been able to find it by exploring all of the settings and options. The other negative to the camera that you need to be aware of... is the delay or lag time, from the time you press the \"shoot\" button, until the image is actually captured. You will miss some precious moments such as the look on a child's face sometimes. I understand though that you can shoot video and then screen capture a specific moment in the video, to accomplish precise photo saves. Haven't learned houw to do that yet. My digital daughters are going to show me.  Other than that, the quality of the photos are better than all of the point and shoot cameras that I have owned over the years, although I never took the plunge for a Nikon or Canon digital SLR. The colors are precise, bright and overall fantastic. I had no idea what I was missing by not having a great camera on my person at all times, in the form of this phone.",

Great piece of mind for potential of dropping into the sink, running through the washing machine by accident, etc. It is officially rated to 1 to 2 feet deep, so I considered buying the LifeProof case which has better water depth protection, but there were an abundance of negative reviews for that case for this phone....which causes severe echo on phone conversations. I did buy the Otterbox Defender which is absolutely fantastic for this phone, for additional shock drop protection, cosmetic protection, and a screen protection which so far has been as scratch resistant as the best selling screen protector, \"Invisible Shield\", by Zagg (which seems to be the default choice for most purchasers). Subsequently, I discovered that Otterbox has the \"Preserver\" case which is waterproof, for about 50 bucks more than the Defender. Wish I had known that before. Probably would have bought it instead. But extremely happy with the Defender since I don't plan on taking it deep sea diving or snorkeling.",

And there's the $30 activation fee and the old 'by-the-way', that unlimited data plan you were grandfathered into no longer applies. I now get 2 GB and additional fees apply if that is exceeded. But, they assured me that after the initial bill with the activation fee, my Family Plan bill would remain the same. I'll update that if that turns out to be false.",

IF you are on the phone and need to look at an email, you cant.  If you want to look up something on the internet  while talking on the phone you cant.  This is finally the straw that broke this camels back.. I purchased this phone through best buy and then three days later took it back to BB and returned it.  I have left Sprint and went to Verizon where you CAN talk and surf at the same time.  Sprints says they will have this feature once they update to the Spark network but that it will take a while to reach all areas.. much like it did for 4g I have been with sprint for over 10 years now and they are always behind.

With a dry finger I can unlock the phone probably 80% of the time on the first try. After an initial failure I can almost always get the phone unlocked using additional attempts at the finger scan. I like the fact that I can add memory to it, up to 128 GBytes. Being that it is an Android phone, there is a large variety of apps available. My favorite is Google Maps (comes preloaded). It is turn-by-turn navigation which also shows real-time traffic information. That is a real time-saver.

If you own an S5 and are shopping for a standard non-enthusiast grade digital camera... Save your money and use the S5. As an amateur photographer with DSLR's and an enthusiast grade large sensor compact with manual control that is saying something. I have yet to take an image and send it to a photo printer but from looking at them on HD screens I am super impressed. Focusing is fast and low light photos turn out unexpectedly good.

He asked me to look at it since it already had a small crack in in the corner of the screen and he couldn't get it warrantied.  You cannot access the display connectors on these phones from the back.  You have to remove the screen.  Using a hotplate, I warmed the display and gently separated the screen from the body.

But I couldn't talk and use internet connection simultaneously without being connected to WIFI.  That included using apps that required internet connection.  My service was also horrible especially at home.  HTC said it was the network and Sprint said the phone did have issues interfacing with their network but this was due to the manufacturer switching from the dual antenna to a single antenna.  I got a new HTC M8 and the same thing occurred.  I was told I was the only customer with this complaint.  At this point, I was three weeks into my purchase and I needed a phone.  So I reluctantly switched to the Samsung S5.  I love HTC so didn't really want to switch.  I don't like the case.  Phone looks flimsy.  Yes great device with great features but my concern is the service.  Once again, I have a phone that cannot talk and use the Internet simultaneously without being connected to the WiFi.  Single antenna. Great at home since I have WiFi but what about when I am on the go.  I have to disconnect my call and then I can use apps (that require Internet connection) or just to send an email.  My service is still poor especially at home even with the signal booster that sprint provided.  I also have 5g home network provided via charter.  My new Samsung 5 phone can't connect to it.  It connects to 2g just like my old laptop and Samsung tablet that I purchased 2 years ago. I don't know if its the phone,  the interface with the network,  or just the Sprint network.  This has been my experience and I think you should do your homework in your coverage area before you buy either the HTC M8 or Samsung S5 especially if you are in Alabama and Sprint is your carrier.  I didn't have this problem with my HTC Evo and neither of my four household members have this problem and we are all on Sprint and they use HTC Evo  and Apple 4.",

S Health has proven to contain very accurate nutrition information on a vast amount of foods. It also possesses a heart rate detector and a pedometer, both of which can be very useful to any health-conscious individual. The phone has a very large and beautiful display but still weighs a mere 5.12 ounces. The camera on this smartphone is impeccable. I also like that you can transfer your entire iTunes library to the phone using Google Play. There is no need to download a new media player and purchase everything again. Other reviews state that the plastic on the back of the phone is a drawback but I disagree. Glass phones break very easily but I have dropped this phone multiple times without any surface damage being done. It is a considerably sturdy phone. Lastly, the S5's battery life is nothing to overlook. The advertisements state that the battery will last through 29 hours of talk time. I have personally experienced an instance showing how great the phone keeps its charge when I took it on a four hour car trip and streamed music online the entire time without losing more than 20% of the battery. After the battery dies completely, it only takes an hour and a half to charge back to 100%.",

I can talk about all the things on this phone that would be good features, but what does it matter if the phone is broken. What does it matter that the phone is supposed to be \"water resistant\" YOU CANNOT PUT THIS PHONE IN WATER!!!. If you close the phone properly and water still gets in, they will tell you that it was still your fault that it doesn't work. Because there in unfortunately and conveniently almost no way to prove that the phone stopped working due to faulty merchandise. I bought one of these and through my warranty plan replaced it for $200.00 when my first phone broke due to water damage. Then I got a second one, of which I had for about 3 days, before it broke too. that phone broke when I went swimming. I was in shallow water, and for a very short amount of time. I made sure that everything was closed securely on this phone before I went swimming due to previous experience. When this phone stopped working, I took it to a certified Samsung repair store. The phone failed the pressure test, proving that the faulty merchandise was in fact not \"water resistant at all\" they also said that the corrosion in the phone was irreparable. When I called corporate with these findings from their OWN store. They said it was not SAMSUNG POLICY to replace THEIR phones even the faulty ones. That replacement can ONLY be done through your phone service provider. EVEN THOUGH THE PHONE WAS ONLY IRREPAIRABLE BASED ON THEIR FAULTY MERCHANDISE TO BIGIN WITH! We tried going through our service provider to return this phone. They wanted us to give them another $200. We would not agree to this! We decided to cancel our service completely and go with another phone service. NO one wanted to give us a working phone, or our money back! They sent us a faulty phone and offered NO GARANTEE. This phone can and will sometimes break in water. IT IS NOT a  WATERPROOF PHONE! They will not  replace it should it become irreparable, EVEN IF IT IS THEIR FAULT!!  Who wants to spends hundreds of dollars on any phone without any kind of guarantee the phone will work. IT IS SMASUNGS POLICY TO NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCTS. I am never buying anything Samsung again. AND not just because I am angry with how they \"resolved\" my issue. But also because I am concerned that I will have to deal with SAMSUNGS POOR POLICY and NO GARANTEES again!

With those seeming to work and the occasional tap, I must assume that the issue is an electronics connection on the motherboard or between the video card and display.

It's probably the most durable of current flagship phones on the market right now (quality plastic without cheap feel, better than easily broken glass and dented aluminum). The water/dust proofing also contributes to improved durability, and of course it has Gorilla Glass 3. Additionally, the design is very portable and comfortable, despite the size. The performance is top-par, running on multi-core benchmarks as the current fastest. 1080p screen is flawless, for those desiring 4K quality of the LG G3, consider the fact that physiologically you can't really even tell the difference on a phone-size screen between 1080p and quad until it's within 6 inches from your eyes. Touch-wiz is wonderful to use, and the phone is loaded with small conveniences, both in hardware and touchwiz. The small features I have found useful include the IR emitter with smartremote app, heart rate monitor (and S-Health app in general, it's an awesome fitness application), one-hand use, ultra power saving mode (extreme battery life), multi-window, private mode, and the fingerprint lock (more for convenience than security: it's secure but quicker than a pattern or code). The camera is about as good as you'll find, though there are a few specific camera-phones out there with better features. Battery life is one of the most important things to me, and the standard battery with normal usage is excellent; the best of current flagships excluding the Motorola Droid Maxx, and the power saving options allow you to bring the usage down so low as to get several days on a charge (if you use it only for calling and messaging, like your old flip phone).

In the first few days, it took three Verizon Wireless Customer Service Reps to set up the email functions.  Ironically, the primary email was a Verizon email address.  None of the Reps considered the set up to be a \"hardware\" issue.  I discussed replacing this Samsung with a new unit, but they asked me to try more solutions.  Then on the 16th day, two days after the 14-day return policy expired, the phone failed so completely that it could not make calls or text messages.  Finally on the 17th day after the purchase, Verizon acknowledged that it was a hardware problem and agreed to replace it with a refurbished unit.  I asked for a different model or a brand new unit, the Verizon Rep denied the request because the \"return\" was made a couple days after the 14-day return policy based on the arrangement with Samsung, and they had too much inventory on Samsung S5 to offer another brand.  The Rep did not consider the first three technical calls to be \"hardware\" related, even though email had been working perfectly fine on the old Motorola phone just an hour before switching to Samsung.  Everyone of the Reps blamed the issues with the third party app developer not working properly with Android devices.  They alluded that Facebook, Yelp, and many other popular apps would \"interfere\" with the performance of the phone.  The phone was bad to start with, Verizon service made the experience even worse.  Please explore other options when consider buying this phone.  I will switch to another wireless carrier the first opportunity.",

They warn you there are other fees, but will not tell you what they are other than the $40.00 initiation fee.  Well, people, there are so many fees you'll pay a huge amount over the online quote.  And the $80.00 a month charge for the 2 gig mobile sharing plan listed here is likewise not really what it's going to cost you.  All those unlisted fees and surcharges will cost you $94.88 in the end, almost $15.00 a month, or $180.00 per year, over what you thought you were signing up for.  This has gotta stop.

It's light, thin, and compact.  Considering what this phone does, I'm impressed with it's diminutive size & weight.  One change that I'm finding difficult adjusting to are the Home & Back buttons, and the new one on the left you press to dispaly which apps were recently in use.  This last one is really handy, as we all tend to use mostly the same handful of apps, and this is a really quick way to open them up.",

I agree with most of the positive reviews of the phone and coming from a Droid 3, it took me a while to get the hang of the new interface and download all the apps I had purchased on the Droid.  To my surprise, Verizon (or my sdcard) remembered which apps I had purchased and I was able to download and reinstall free of charge.  Saved me about $20 in apps alone.  Phone is big and easy to read, but not too big, and surprisingly light and thin (remember this morning I was still using my Droid3 brick).  Some important observations: 1) The included headphones are totally lacking base and sound washed out.  Not even close to the quality of the Creative Zen I was using so I will continue with the Zen.  2) When ordering on Amazon, I chose the \"replace a phone on my existing account\" option.  But the checkout chose to change my data plan and \"estimated\" I will be paying $40 more a month than I was.  Called Amazon and Verizon and the consensus was to let the sale go through and change the plan back when I activate the phone.  Well after activating on the phone, the plan did not change.

I could hold it for hours and my hand wouldn't tire!!! Another feature I have loved is the interchangeable batteries!!! I don't think I could ever do without this again, one battery dies just pop in another and your good to go! Buy this phone, you won't regret it! There's a reason this phone is the number 1 selling phone on amazon!",

        "reviewText": "So, here's an honest review; I don't know if I got a bad unit or not, but I didn't care enough to have it replaced; I just sold it at a loss.  Let's get the obvious out of the way; the design and materials on this thing are terrible.  The camera bulges out, and if you don't put this sucker in a case, you are going to scratch up the glass.  The whole unit looks like it was designed by fisher price; perhaps I'm a bit spoiled, coming from an iPhone, but c'mon, even that fake metal ring around the phone looks cheap.  The flap for the charger takes some getting used to; start growing long nails!  But if you are willing to overlook the design, the real kicker is the touchwiz monstrosity that is preload on this phone.  If you are used to a consistent user experience, well, it got up and left the building, and brought all his friends with it.  Colors, circles, squares, ripples, oh my!  I have a pity on a fool that opens up the settings menu!  Endless sea of circle icons!  This is the most complex UI I've ever used!  But on the other hand, one might say, it has the horsepower to chew through all those layers of gummy bear UI, right?  Wrong!  Touchwiz stutters, lags, and sometimes crashes and restarts; watching Netflix heats up the phone enough for you to cook eggs on!  That brings me to another topic; battery life.  I can't relate to any of the glowing reviews on here about battery life, but the battery life on this thing lasts for 8 hours; on stand by.  Yeah, there are no rouge processes running in the background, the signal strength is OK, and yet, by 3pm, I have about 30% battery left, and when I get home, the phone is dead.  I'm now tied to a charger everywhere I go; I have one at home, at work, and 2 in the car, just in case I get stranded somewhere and one of the chargers breaks.  Also, the unit does have some physical defects, the front facing camera wasn't seated properly, and there is a small piece of plastic covering the top portion of it.  Whenever I try to do a Skype or the likes, the other person enjoys the view of my neck.  I would assume this is a defect or a phone for ugly people; I don't know!  The device also fails at basic phone functionality too; whenever I receive a call, sometimes the screen would remain dark.  I would wait 1 ring, 2 rings, 3 rings, I would tap the screen a couple of times, shake the device in a voodoo fashion, hit the power button, and then eventually the screen would turn on, and inform me that I missed the call.  Hmm...  One would think that these reasons are enough to avoid this device at all costs, but it's not over yet.  Bluetooth stack on this thing was probably written by a 6 year old; it doesn't work!  It's Snap, Crackle and Pop all the way to the magic forest, with occasional Bluetooth crash here and there.  At first I though it was incompatibility, but then I realized, it's the same with any Bluetooth device.  It made Bluetooth audio useless with this device!  I couldn\u2019t list to music in the car, in the house; my only other option was to run an audio wire, circa 1970\u2019s.  The speakerphone is on the back of the phone and is tinny; crank it up during a conference call, and it starts to crackle.  But it\u2019s not all gloom and doom; perhaps a device can be forgiven for all its innumerable flaws, once you gaze upon the gorgeous AMOLED screen!  It is truly a sight to see, no doubt about it.  This is perhaps, the only advantage that this phone has going for it; this, and the camera.  It does take good-looking shots, whether indoors or out, so you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed by the pictures you take.  Overall, it\u2019s hard to recommend this device over something like an iPhone, or an HTC One; heck even Xperia Z2 is eons ahead of Samsung!  If it weren\u2019t for that screen, this phone would have flopped!",

After putting me on hold for a couple minutes, she told me that I would have to send the charger to them with the receipt. They would evaluate it to be sure there was no damage, and then send me another. This would take up to 11 days. Happily, I have the charger from my previous phone.

The Android interface is easy to learn and before you know it, you will be tweaking the interface to fit your personal needs.

The HTC audio wins hands down as does its basic appearance, but the Samsung phones are also great.  This black phone is more of a dark gray than true black and the entire case is plastic, giving it a cheaper appearance.  I love the Electric Blue color, but since all phones are protected by case covers, the rears are not visible anyway.  Unlike the HTC, this one offers a removable battery, which along with its superior camera, are why we purchased a pair of these on Verizon Wireless.  The phone arrives loaded with apps which are unnecessary and not wanted, so what we could easily remove, we did.  The Health app is used daily by my daughter, I'm not as diligent myself.  A weakness of this phone, particularly as compared to the HTC, is the rear speaker which muffles the audio while the phone is resting.  I've found that by keeping it face down, it's easier to hear.  The fingerprint security option hasn't worked well for either of us, so it's not currently being used.  Samsung uses its own power port, think of a conjoined USB with a smaller twin port, the same as the Samsung tablet.  In general, this is a really good phone which I expect will last the two years of our contract.",

Honestly though I wanted to purchase an Iphone but more importantly I wanted to purcahse the best phone out there.  I am afraid that at that time (april 2014 and even now this is the best phone available.  I have an Ipad, and Ipod and and MacBook, so I am semi invested into the Apple platform,  but what put me over the edge was 4 features.  1.  Larger Screen,  2. removable battery,  3.  Micro SD  card slot (allowing me to add up to 64 Megabytes. ) 4. Value for a top tier smart phone(I paid $99 3 weeks after this phone was released)  Truth is that apple isn't going ever have number 2 or 3 or 4.  Likely this fall the  Number 1(larger screen) will be filled,  and one can purchase a higher capacity Iphone but I purchased a 32 gigabyte SD card for $16 and well the Iphone is already more money and upping the Gig's is just expensive.  This combined with the fact that IMHO there was no killer feature on the Iphone 5S.  I think the fingerprint scanner has the potential to be the killer feature but until Apple opens up the API to 3rd parties.  Even then I think Apple needs to somehow forge a partnership with a major bank to make so I can leave my wallet at home.  This would be a killer feature.

It came with a pair of headphones with a mic that also work really well for calls or music.  The phone is plenty powerful, applications are quick to respond, and the recent apps button that replaces the menu button lets you swap between recently used apps, and it happens so fast, it almost feels like multi-tasking.  Its really an amazing phone.  My only complaint, was very minor, in that I couldn't find the sd card slot.  It is right on top of the sim card slot, which makes it easy to miss.

Another thing is you can really customize the screens with adding and organizing your apps and files to be to your preference. Makes it more personalized to your liking and personality.

The settings are presented differently than my past phone, but still easy to maneuver. There was one instance, I inadvertently clicked a setting that was influencing my screens. Had to call Samsung technical support. The tech was extremely kind, patient and knowledgeable. He also helped me with other \"bells and whistles\" that were unfamiliar to me. Probably, spent 35-40 minutes discussing my needs. I would recommend this phone on Samsung's support service alone. Other features that stand out are:  it's LONG BATTERY life; Plus, a 30% battery life lasts forever in the \"ULTRA POWER-SAVING MODE\".  Have not had good luck with the fingerprint scanner. Occasionally it will recognize my print, but after 5 swipes...your out. Must put in pass word. For me, just as easy to start with the password.

Most if not all of the following problems are common just do a google search and you will see.  Firstly, as with a lot of locked DROID phones this one (at least the ATT model) has a bloated user interface over KitKat.  Just look at the free space on this phone vs others.  I went from a nexus5 to this phone and the difference between OS/KITKAT fluidity was night and day.  This phone is constantly locking up and hanging and at least once a day required me to remove the battery to do a hard restart.  Even the boot graphics are glitchy...really samsung? When the phone is locked sometimes the screen will no come back on when you unlock it.  The finger print lock requires you to stroke your finger at a very specific angle or it wont work. I had about only a 60% success rate after using it for about 2 weeks so I went back to a pin lock.  Camera has a really hard time focusing on really close objects and constantly hangs while taking pics and switching between picture modes sometimes locking the phone up.  KITKAT has limited the user's ability to write to an external SD card so forget about copying music to it and popping it in your media player wont be able to read the songs.  A root could easily fix this and the other issues if one were willing to forgo their phone's warranty but guess what not only is the ATT boot loader locked but it is encrypted so forget about trying to root it for now.  Such a shame too with a root I think this would be the best phone out there but no way to really tell if the phone hardware is buggy or the User Interface.  Personally I would avoid this phone it is a classic example of what looks good spec wise on paper does not always translate into how good the device is.  Very very buggy phone which is unacceptable given this is the 5th series in the samsung S line.",

There is a companion app called S-health that allows you to keep track of diet and exercise. In an increasingly health conscious world I find that very helpful. The fingerprint scanner is a good layer of security, but make no mistake, if someone is determined to get in your phone they will find a way. It's more of a safeguard just like having a password would be.",

The fingerprint scanner is a great feature. I had no problems with the response or speed of the phone. Still had some network issues with calls but, I'm use to it with Sprint. After all that, I discovered that this phone does not allow you to Talk & Surf at the same time. For the entire week, I was on a call and made several attempts to get on the internet or do something data related and I would get a \"no connection\" error. I thought there must be a setting I was missing, so I tried changing the networks to all that was available (CDMA, LTE/CDMA, GSM, Automatic). Each time, I would make a phone call and try the internet and it never worked. Which means, there's no Facebooking, Instagraming, Hangouts, Google Maps/Search, BBM, Twitter, GroupMe...NOTHING data related while on a call. The only time it works is when the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi zone. This was UNACCEPTABLE for me! Hence, the reason I gave it 2 stars. I upgraded from an S3 to the S5 and never had an issue with surfing the net while on a call on my S3. I Talk & Surf everyday. Apparently, this phone was developed with the new 'Spark LTE' network which does not allow Talk & Surf. You can only do one at a time due to a hardware change in the phone from dual band to single band. If you're in the middle of downloading, uploading, surfing, etc., and a call comes in, the phone will immediately cut off your data and will not resume until you end the call. I Googled this issue and it is legitimate based on Sprint Community Forums. Also, I contacted the local Sprint store and they verified this as well. Therefore, I returned the S5 before my grace period was up and got the Note 3 instead. Now, I can Talk & Surf again!!",
