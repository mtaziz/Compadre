I can still get messages on the watch and see who's calling without having to take off all of the gear which is just great for knowing if I need to answer the call now or if I can return to them later. I've taken it into the shower with me and it works great for that as well. If I need to take a fast shower and run out, I can still see what time it is and get all my calls and messages. The screen is pretty strong too. I have some minor scratches on it...

Don't know if it is worth it to get the Steele or new Time version since iPhones are not well supported.  I didn't need all the other stuff, however it would have been nice.

It is great to be able to get email, text, phone, missed call, emergency alerts and other notifications on my wrist without pulling out the phone - and even to hang up my phone calls from my wrist when on Bluetooth in the car.  I read some of the other issues with dropped bluetooth but have rarely had an issue except when recharging or turning bluetooth off.  The only gripe is that the watch band is cheesy and the pin dropped and was lost within a week.  I purchased a replacement fabric band (available on line or through best buy) but it relies on having the pins to thread through so I had to pilfer from other pieces of the broken band.  This would be a much better and better looking watch with optional color fabric bands instead of the plastic and either improving the quality of the pin/band hardware or including a replacement.",

It is great with notifications, being able to change a song on my phone and checking the scores on MLB. The design is pretty cool and as far as the strap goes, it's great. What I didn't like was the pedometer on this watch. There are very few apps that work well. I tried the UP app, the watch faces aren't great, I would just like to be able to see the time and how many steps I've taken. You can't have both with UP, more, if you download the app on your phone, the syncing was always off, and by hundreds of steps. I found this very frustrating as I do like to see my stats for a week/month long. The UP watch face only stores up to 7 days. Other apps failed to sync correctly with my phone and most of the time had to be the watch face showing in order for it to track. Of the two watch faces I downloaded for their style, both always crashed and left only the watch faces that came pre-loaded with the watch reliable. Last and final con I found was the black patch that formed in the watch just only after 2-3 weeks of use. I tried factory resetting many times and this black patch just got worse as time went by. Fortunately, Pebble's tech support is amazing and after some emails and pictures I was told I would be getting a replacement for free. If my dog hadn't eaten the warranty and directions information from the box, I would have sent this watch back to Amazon after a week of use as I just didn't love it. So even though I am getting a replacement for free, I do wish I was just getting my money back, I would even take half. If I could give 2.5 stars I would because I think this is a good watch, just buggy and I personally just not for me.",

I've spent $100 for A G Shock watch that doesn't have near as many features as my Pebble does. The battery lasts for days and charges to full capacity in about an hour.  From apps that track your sleep and activity to being able to control your music from your wrist makes Pebble a watch for everyone. Works for Android and IPhone.  If people want a phone with bigger screens, why would you want a $250 Moto360, $300 Samsung Gear, or $349 IPhone watch with too many bells and whistles? You are going to be within Bluetooth range of your phone to use any of these watches. Plus battery life on other watches don't last as long and most you can't read in the sun or without shaking your wrist. Plus you can get wraps and wristbands to personalize the Pebble to your style and wardrobe.",

Easy to navigate, very bright in sunshine, 5-7 Day battery life, quick to recharge, rated only behind the Apple Smart Watch and LG G Watch R in Consumer Reports. 7th out of 10.  I paired with a Ritchie 22mm Stainless Bracelet purchased from Amazon for around $12. 3rd Party Misfit app tracks steps and sleep activity, seems accurate compared to I-Phone activity app.  Pandora app works well in my car. Text messages, email and I phone notifications work flawlessly. Keep you phone in your pocket, and stay in touch with notifications.  Even have a Rolex watch face for time and date. Also watch face with temperature, battery level and wind reported by Y-Weather. For about $100 bucks from Amazon keep the change you save from Apple and take your significant other to a nice dinner, or two.",

After a few weeks, the LCD screen started distorting with lines through it. You could clear it up by pressing the down button a few times and refreshing the scree, but it got worse over time. Now I can't even read most notifications that come in. I started the RMA process with Pebble, which was pretty annoying. They sent me a new watch after more than a week (USPS SLOW!). Turns out, the new watch won't charge at all. Yes, I checked everything, and no it wasn't just the cord. Now I have to RMA the new watch they sent me and go through the whole process again.

Trust me for 14.99 that's a great investment.  The screen scratches easily despite of what they say on the box. The screen is covered in some sort of  plastic, so be careful not to squish it against anything either. I've mentioned this one was 2nd Pebble, that's because I broke the 1st ones screen. Their not that resilient and under a little pressure the LCD cracks. However, since there not too expense, your better off purchasing a new one then repairing it. The Pebble Steel has Gorilla Glass to protect the LCD, so maybe that's a better alternative if your worried about breaking it.

What sold me on it was that the watch vibrates when you get a call on your smartphone. My phone is silenced on vibrate during meetings and I often don't feel the phone attached to my belt vibrate, but it's hard to miss a vibrating watch that also displays the number or contact calling or text message on the watch. I can casually look at my watch to see if it's a call I can ignore with a push of a button on the watch, or take the call on the phone. The Pebble isn't a Dick Tracy watch, but there is a wristband app that supposedly helps the Pebble come close to that. I'm thrilled with my Pebble as is. I found it extremely intuitive to use and downloaded apps to get baseball scores and an activity tracker (pedometer). When using the ESPN baseball app, the watch gives a brief vibrate when a team scores. The clock display is easy to read during night and day and the display style can be easily changed with the push of a button. For one of the first smart phones on the market, the Pebble really delivers at a great price compared to other smart phones now or soon available. Pebble is functional and has also helped me rediscover my inner nerd. Pebble easily deserves five stars for its innovation story and execution of product.",

For something this small, I don't really see the benefit of an lcd screen.  The only caveat, when using something that may be Bluetooth heavy, like gps, it seems battery life is almost cut in half.  But that is still a couple of days of battery. Also, the screen can be hard to read if you wear polarized sunglasses.  Inexpensive, durable, and functional.

Can display multiple things on the screen i.e. weather time and date. And it can give me notifications from my apps on my dmart phone. It is sad to say i am one of those people that jumps every time my phones ring tone goes off. With this i can see the notification of what it is and see if its important enough for my to pull my phone out. I love the vibration feature. It is less annoying than the beeps that come from most normal watches.  Also the diffent features you can put on the pebble is great.  You can make the watch have the features you want. Now my 3 star rating comes from the apps. To beabke be able to do the super cool send a response to a sms or whats app message...you need to buy a 2 dollar app. Also if you really look at it the Pebble is a churched up tomigochie that all you have to do is plug it in so it doesnt die.",

I don't always want to pull my phone out of my pocket because I could be busy and dont want to respond, as alot of people would agree. The cool thing about this is that, with some extra apps (like Glance, Pebble dialer, music boss, etc.) you can really make this thing useful. Fore me, I use glance to keep track of and send SMS's. I also use glance for Weather and Stocks. However, because glance doesnt have a watchface yet, I use Canvas to create your own watchfaces, for things that matter to you. As far as the construction of the watch goes, its ok. I mean, its not like a rolex, but it gets the job done. Things that the pebble has that all smartwatches should have is 1. Long battery life (5-7 days), 2. Waterproof design (up to 5 atm), 3. Developmental support (seriously, the pebble app store is gigantic and full of different apps, games, etc.), and 4. Great Price (99 dollars is a great price and is cheaper than all of the smartwatches out there!)",

The e-paper display seemed to have ink that had bled inside as if something had pressed hard on the screen (think of pressing your finger on a computer screen that's not a touch screen). Mine was purchased from Target and when I went to exchange it of course they only had the all black Pebble's which is not what I wanted, I wanted the one with the red face. So course I contacted Pebble via email and Twitter.",

But it was on Pebble's own Twitter support page that I saw so many people complaining of screen issues happening on their watches. Everything from what I was experiencing to random lines going across the screen to the screen just stop working all together. After viewing all of this I made the decision to instead return the watch all together and my wife shelled out the extra $$$ and got me a Moto 360 instead. There appears to be some major quality control issues going on at Pebble which hopefully resolves in the future as I would love to own one of their watches because the one I had worked well. It worked just as good, if not better, than the Moto 360 I currently use now.",

Pebble really needs to keep a better check on its developers and QA and stop pushing reckless updates - it's an immature company in terms of supporting an ecosystem.

Equally nice to be able to accept calls while I'm still fishing out the phone from the purse so I won't miss a call.  While doing chores, or sitting backyard, I have music on paired with a Bluetooth speaker and can simply accept a call and start talking without ever having to even touch the phone. It is very handy for this.  Love the alarm and multiple timer features where it vibrates providing discreet buzzing. Backlighting kicks on for only a couple seconds when I flick my wrist is useful at night. Only takes 2-3 hrs for a full charge. overall, I'm happy that it knows it's limitations and not try to do too much but perhaps can overextend with complicated methods.  Outside software developers need to keep in mind that the watchface is only so big...can't do things like GPS maps on it and think you can see anything ,so we can't expect for it to do everything just because technology allows.",

Law says that I can't be fiddling with my phone if I'm driving a commercial vehicle and this watch (along with my headset) really helps me out in a lot of areas.  I can listen to music or my audiobooks (MusicBoss app on Google Play), make a phone call from the watch (Dialer on the Pebble App Store), and change watch faces depending on my mood (free watch faces on the Pebble App Store).  I get my text messages and emails and when I get a phone call it tells me who is calling.  All without me having to pull my phone out of my pocket or dig through the menus trying to do something.  I just recently bought a different watchband to dress it up a little (search Truffol here on Amazon and you'll find it - this band really should be a standard offer along with the watch!!).  The standard rubber watch band is nice and holds up well to anything, but I just prefer a watchband that has the clasp underneath instead of the buckle that seems to always get in my way.  Just my preference, really.  Specs say you can get between 5-7 days of battery life on the Pebble and I find that I get 7-8 days out of it.  I don't push buttons a lot or tinker with it all the time, so that might have a lot to do with it.  If you use yours to play games (there are games for this!), then your battery life will be different.  I've already had a few people ask me how I like it and I'm more than happy to tell them how much I enjoy it.  For all it does, you can't beat the price.  Add the app store with so many free offerings, and you will really get your money's worth IMHO.  There seems to be no end to the apps that have been developed for just about any need.",

Anything other than basic \"phone\"  or \"music\" functions (incoming calls, alerts, controlling music) requires the Pebble application to be running on the phone. The problem is that iOS loves to suspend the application any time the device is locked or Pebble is in the backgroud. Ostensibly, this is to conserve memory - but it still happens even when nothing else is running. So Get Back and Pebble GPS - two applications that need realtime data feeds from the iPhone  - require you to keep the phone up and awake. If you're doing that, just do navigation from your phone's screen. The same is true of all of the watchfaces that show the weather. They will update once and not update until you get the Pebble app open on the phone. All of this is extraordinarily poor engineering on someone's part.",

I wanted to give it a try as a foray into the smart watch world to see if it would make me more productive or efficient over what it is to have just a cell phone in the pocket.  To be honest, after having the watch for over two weeks and exploring the different apps and features I can honestly say that I would not continue to wear this watch (or any other at the moment).  I am a big fan of watches in general and the smart watch arena is lacking in many areas.  But, in regards to this particular watch, there were just not enough pro's to outweigh the cons.  For instance, if you wear any sort of corrective eyewear I will tell you that this watch is very hard to see anywhere besides broad daylight.  Even with the backlight it is still very hard to see. The design is very poor as in it just looks terrible on a wrist.  It looks like a plastic watch.  Even with the skins available, the watch still looks cheaply made.  The apps do not come in handy at all really.  There are apps for weather, calendars, compasses, etc. But all in all none of these things added any productivity to my day.  In fact, it simply just made me look at my watch for every single thing that came across my phone.  I wanted to really like it being a tech junkie and all, but I will have to say that the phone is the stopping point for me.  I will stick with my time - telling watches that look nice and save the money.",

As far as the other features, my sons and husband are excited because I definitely miss less of their phone calls, I get all my alerts through the phone albeit sometimes there are delays. Latest update caused me some issues but were quickly resolved with a follow up update. I definitely did NOT like the armband though. I'm a female and it was not a becoming look nor professional.

However, there are some watch faces that you can download from the Pebble Store on your phone that will vibrate your watch when the bluetooth disconnects.  In order for that to work, however, that watch face must be running at the time that the bluetooth disconnects in order to be notified that it has disconnected...the watch does not \"multitask\".  In short, do not rely on receiving a notification from the watch telling you that it has lost the bluetooth connection.  You shouldn't have to worry about connection, however.

The Pebble utilizes a low-powered display that may not look as pretty but it is able to stay on all of the time which I think is much more convenient.  The display has a backlight, and there are a few options you can set with the backlight: you can set it to always turn on when you get a notification or push a button, to only turn on when you get a notification or push a button in a low-light setting (recognized via the watch's ambient light sensor), or to never turn on.  You can also set the watch to turn on the backlight when you flick your wrist (so that you can quickly check the time).  I have mine set to only turn on the backlight in low-light settings...this way I save some battery since I am keeping the backlight from turning on when I don't need it to.

Therefore, there is a little bit of extra effort to keep the Pebble working on iPhone.  Almost every time that I power on my Pebble for the day and connect it to my phone, I receive a notification on my phone asking to allow Pebble to communicate with my phone.  Notifications to your Pebble will not work until you accept this message on your phone.  It is a minuscule thing to do once a day, but it is crucial for receiving notifications on your watch, so don't forget to do it!  Sometimes the message will not appear and notifications work just fine.  Other times, the message will not appear and notifications do not work!  To fix this, simply open the Pebble app.  After opening the app, everything should start working as long as you have a bluetooth connection.  To be safe, every day when I connect my Pebble, I open the Pebble app on my phone and then close it.  That should take care of everything.  Just be careful not to completely close the app from the background (on iPhone, double tapping the home button and closing it through the multitasking tray).

I work and play outside a lot, often with gloves, so pulling my phone out every time I hear it chirp or ring is frustrating.  I use a Samsung Galaxy S3, so I looked at the Samsung Gear watch thinking it would be a great tool to have.  After reading reviews, and realizing that it isn't even water resistant, I decided it would not be a good choice, not to mention the price tag.  I also didn't really like the idea of another touchscreen that I couldn't use with gloves very well.  The Pebble seemed to be a good choice for me, seeing that it is waterproof, and not a touch screen.  I wasn't sure the size and style were going to all that desirable, but decided to give it a try.  After opening the package, I realized the size of the watch wasn't going to be a problem.  It is relatively slim, fits well on my wrist (though the band was apparently designed for people with much smaller wrists than mine), and looks good!  I've been wearing an analog dive watch for 7 years, so knowing that I can still use a traditional watch face is nice.  After getting to know the watch now, though, I don't use the analog face anymore, but prefer to use one that conveys much more information than the time.  For those that like to be kept up to date in places where cell phones are frowned upon (school, movie theater, meetings) this thing is great.  It vibrates on your wrist, so if your phone is silenced, or you are snowmobiling, or on a noisy jobsite, you can easily feel the vibration.",

Anyway This watch would EASILY get 5 stars if they had better quality control. My first watch had a display problem after a few hours of use. There was artifacts all over the screen and would get unusable, i could temporarily fix the problem by pushing down on the top and bottom of the display and then changing the watch face or scrolling up and down. The problem would come back really soon though. Luckily I bought it in a local store so I just exchanged it for a new one and I haven't had an issue since. The pebble is great because it isn't only a watch. you can link it to companion software to turn it into a sleep tracker a pedometer a fitness tracker play games on it, check in with foursquare check yelp check the time and weather get reminders read your texts and IMs etc. The possibilities are literally endless with pebble. For those on android still waiting for pebble to release the appstore update to playstore, you can find the beta software here [...]  I hope this review has helped you make your decision or helped you get your pebble apps with android. Thank you!",

Yes, Pebble now has an app store, but the watch is still just a glorious way to receive cell phone notifications on your watch.  It is rather useless otherwise.  If you are wanting a true, functioning smartwatch that will do MANY things, this watch is NOT the one for you.  I would look toward the Galaxy Gear or wait for Apple to come out with a smartwatch.

Instantly, I know whether the call or message is important enough to pull my iPhone out of my pocket and answer, or whether it's something that can wait until after I finish my meeting. Although I find the battery life on my Pebble is slightly less than the 5 to 7 days advertised, this is of little concern because I'm already used to recharging my iPhone daily.

Additionally it provides me the current weather to include if it is sunny or cloudy and the current temperature.  It tells me what t percent my battery is on my cellphone and also gives me the date/time of my next appointment and what that appointment is.  This is all on one easy to read screen without having to push a single button.  I like the flick of the wrist to turn on the back light when in a dark setting.  The watch is very light (you hardly know that you have it on your wrist). One morning, I put on my regular analog watch and about an hour later, I went back to my Pebble as I missed the information that was not there.

It should also be noted that this was bought at the same time the new steel watch was being sold. The \"upgrades\" are a gorilla glass screen, metal features and a smaller bezel. For $100 more, this does not add much. If you want a metal face then pay for it but you don't need to worry about the screen scratching and thus the gorilla glass isn't really needed. I've had plenty of scrapes and bumps to test this out with. The screens are the same size so if the metal one looks bigger its only perception due to the bezel.

The Pebble Steel just came out (which I just know I'm going to get) and I believe runs SDK 2.0 so you have more options as far as apps, not too mention it looks way more stylish.  The team who put this together looks like they really care about the product and it shows when you use it. There's a good amount of options out there, but Pebble stole my heart.  Until the Galaxy Gear can be compatible with more then 4 devices and have a battery life that lasts longer than a day of full use, I have no reason to look away from Pebble.",

I'm an engineer who spent the last 10 years of my career aspiring for management, tucking in my shirt and going to endless meetings, when I realized that this just isn't who I am. When I switched over to a developer role, I stopped tucking in my shirt, but that just wasn't enough. I really wanted people know that I wasn't just some wanna-be... I am legit! So, when found this watch, I knew this was how I'd get some serious nerd-respect. You see, this isn't just a cool watch that that looks just slightly awkward (an import aspect of nerd apparel) - it can also be \"programmed\". So, when someone asks about the watch, I can carry on a whole conversation with a willing partner about how I \"programmed\" the watch to send text messages, or alerts, or to even turn on my A/C... just with a few button clicks! It's like a nerd magnet, which can leads to all sorts of other choice conversation topics, such as why I ditched Windows for Ubuntu linux on my media center PC, or how I beat Nest by a year with my own home-built web-controlled A/C controller.",

Now it's down to 2 days, even if I turn off the notifications and use a watchface that does not refresh every second. Once the low battery indicator appears in settings, it dies in about 2-3 hours(Pebble's website says that it should last for 12 hours when the low battery icon appears). I have contacted Pebble support 5 times now and all I received was a generic questionnaire about my usage.I responded to that immediately and didn't hear back for 4 days. Now they send me a message saying I need to send them the email using the phone app. It's been over a month now, so I can't even return it. Really wish they step up their support.",

Overall I was just impressed with the simplicity of connecting to my phone and the initial setup because it just works out of the box with almost no configuration needed. I love the feel of the watch as well it is very light and does not get too warm on my wrist or too cold when I am outside like my meta watch did, the band is great as well apposed to leather which cracks and rips over time.

Think of it as an 'extension' \"to\" your phone as a remote control and as a notification system--albeit a limited extension as it can't manipulate apps on your phone--it can only use streams of data from it, e.g. GPS-data.  The phone must be in proximity to the Pebble (Bluetooth range varies) in order to function as a 'smart watch', otherwise it's only good as a watch...it tells time and date. There is tremendous potential here but that's a discussion beyond the scope of this review.",

First, there are other Pebble utilities (e.g. Smartwatch +, SmartWatch Pro, etc.)  that allow you access to weather features, maps, etc. But these are pay-utilities. In other word to really start enjoying the potential of this watch, you need to add these 'foundational utilities' in order to obtain the apps that make the watch more enjoyable to use as a tool. That said, some utilities/apps are pay and some are free, some are OEM type apps (approved for use on Pebble-tested), others are not (not tested or guaranteed). My opinion is that the smart watch needs to come with those baseline utilities/apps or at least make them available through the website. If its a third party vendor app, then sure, you may have to pay for those apps/services--I embrace capitalism, but in the most basic sense, the watch should come with baseline functional apps that showcase its potential. It just makes business sense.",

Finally I pressed a button and cancelled the up date (from the watch) and reconnected with my phone. It updated again and worked fantastically from that point (there was a % indicator on the watch that time. So if you see that you're probably good.) The onboard software let's you receive SMS messages, phone calls, and email on the watch. You can't reply to email or SMS but you can read them. You can see who is calling and also answer phone calls from it though. I will note that my SMS messages never would show up on the watch, even though the test SMS worker. This was problematic. But an easy fix. I'll detail that later. It also has basic music control. It has native Pandora Apollo, and YouTube integration for music control, as well as a paid app (by a third party) called music boss on the play store which extends functionality.

Overall, I love getting texts and call notifications on my wrist.  I miss far fewer messages than in my pre-Pebble, pocket-vibrating days.  Other reviewers are right, though, that the bluetooth connection between watch and phone occasionally drops and then reconnects (usually when they separate by 25 or more feet and then reunite) and that caller ID with contact names rarely works.  I also love controlling music (play, pause, back one track, forward one track); this was really handy on a road trip recently.  And the ability to change faces is just plain fun.  I appreciate all those creative people out there designing watchfaces.  Thank you!!!  There are few apps available right now; the only one I use is a countdown timer.

I use it with android and found out quickly that i can not push all of the notifications with the pebble app so i started looking for a good free supplemental app to get the full functionality and i found couple paid ones like augmented smartwatch pro and then i found a awesome free one called pebble notifier it pushes any app notifications i have on my phone to the pebble i like it for touchdown email that i use for work. i also created a specific email for the watch so i can forward emails from certain people or subjects to the watch.",

The packaging was extremely well done and made the unboxing part of the experience.  Once I charged the watch with the included magnetic connector, setup took about 3 minutes.  Everything was great.  Daily friends and even passersby asked for a look and a demo.  I ran, biked, and swam with the watch as well as wet and dry saunas with no issues in watch performance.  Everything was great...until bumping into a wall in my house after stumbling over my dog in the dark.  I literally bumped the wall without fall or full bodyweight press.  The backlight came on and I noticed the telltale sign of broken screen:  large blotches of dark area and spiderwebbing.",
