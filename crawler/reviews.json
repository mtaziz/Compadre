LG's G3 comes in at 538 ppi, and Apple's iPhone 6 Plus has a 401 ppi pixel density. So, you're not getting the highest pixel density display by any means, however, at 315 ppi, it's probably the best all-around pixel density for a couple reasons: First, you'd really have to strain your eyes to make out a difference above 300 ppi as the human eye has limitations with seeing anything with more saturation than this. Second, having a pixel density of more than 300 ppi can actually prove to be a problem as every pixel requires a tiny amount of power and the more pixels you have to power, the faster the battery drains.",

The Fire OS is nice, but coming from a standard Android OS, I loaded the Google Ecosystem on it with no problems at all, and now have access to Google Play.  Being an unlocked phone, it's very easy to do that, and very reliable.  Quite honestly, you don't need Google, unless you want the Google specific apps, like Gmail, Maps, etc....  The phone is one of the best from a hardware specific point of view.  I wish it was a little bigger, as I previously had an LG G2, which to me, had the perfect screen size.  I purchased the Fire Phone only because my LG G2 got stolen, and I didn't want to pay what unlocked phones were costing, and I didn't want to go down in hardware.  The Fire Phone was on sale, so I bought it with a few reservations, but I'm glad I did, as those reservations never came to pass.  I should also mention that I didn't particularly care for the Fire OS Carousel, so I'm now using the Google Now Launcher.  I'm already a Prime member, so the additional year I received, at no cost with purchase, made it very much worth the price.

I have spent the last week using an LG G2 (hand me down from my wife, her old G2 stopped charging, got it replaced under warranty and upgraded to a G3 the next day). After a week of the G2, which is a very nice phone, I am going back to my Fire Phone, I found that I really missed a couple of features, Firefly and swiping up on the bottom to go back. I haven't heard any rumors of a new model coming, but will be interested in one if they do.",

        "reviewText": "I was a bit hesitant about buying this phone due to all it's bad reviews but when I started really paying attention and began reading those reviews across the internet I soon realized most of the things people were complaining about were not really relevant to me and my needs. I also noticed there appeared to be a lot of \"bandwagon complaining\" with people just piling on with really pointless complaints.  Lastly, I saw that there were a fair amount of people who just didn't pay attention when they bought this phone thinking it was a standard Android phone....though I'm not sure how anyone could have made that mistake unless they were hiding under a rock for the last several months and came out just to buy this phone. I use NET10 and having done my research saw that the Fire phone was compatible with NET10. So when it dropped to $199 I jumped on it.  I used an AT&T SIM card and NET10 as the service.  Transferred my account from my old phone under their \"bring your own phone\" program and everything works great. Like most Amazon devices there's not much of a learning curve and their \"Fire OS\" is about as straight forward as it gets.  As for the lack of standard Google apps.....it took me all of 5 seconds to learn how to sideload google play.  The step by step instructions are located here within another review giving people a link to the site where they can download and install the .apk files.  It's quick, easy, and there's no rooting involved so it doesn't damage the phone in any way that I could tell. It worked fine except for the occasional app crashing.  Having said that I didn't need to do that and the Amazon app store contains all the apps I need, but I just wanted to see if it worked. It did. It's so easy it kind of makes you wonder why Amazon doesn't just let people use the Google play store to begin with.  It's not like Fire OS is some custom made locked down OS...it's just a slightly modified and skinned version of Android.  Of course the standard disclaimer being that If a person chooses to side load anything they are doing so at their own risk.  I would never advise people start screwing around with the OS on their phone just on principle. So all in all it's a great phone.  So why did I give it 4 stars?  Because it's a great phone.....not 5 star great though.",

The exterior buttons are tactile and solid. I had a gift card and some credit card points, so I have less than $100 into this phone, before figuring in the free year of Prime. For an unlocked phone that is a phenomenal deal. I was not about to pay $500+ for an unlocked current-generation Android or iPhone. The interface is quite customized, but previous Android users will feel mostly at home. There are some nice features that improve a little on Android, and a few that are neither here nor there. There's nothing that really annoys me. I've been an iPhone user since the early days and I don't really miss it. The 13MP camera on this phone is excellent. The screen is bright and clear and the size is big enough but not too big. I didn't want a phablet. The speakers are decent for a phone. Of course for any smartphone it's the apps that make the experience. While it's true that this phone does not come with the Google Play store installed, it is quite easy to side-load it and it works perfectly fine. I was able to find the vast majority of the apps I use in the Amazon store, but for the three or four that I couldn't, I got them from the Google Play store with no issues. If you do this, turn off automatic updating in Google Play, because it will try to update the apps you got from Amazon and that can cause problems.",

That's still true, but there are some limitations. I've found that after a day or so Google Play Services (one of the four things you have to install to get the Google store app to work) becomes unstable and crashes repeatedly. The only way to stop it is to uninstall it and reinstall it. That only takes a few seconds if you keep the .apk file on your phone. What I ended up doing is installing the four apk's so I can get what I need from the Google store, and then I uninstall Google Play Services and the Google Play Store until I need them again. Doing this, I've been able to get the few apps I needed that I can't get from the Amazon App Store. The only one I can't get to work at all is Google Hangouts. This app requires Google Play Services to run, and it made me update to a new version of Services, which was very unstable and crashed. So, I just have to live without Google Hangouts on my phone, which really doesn't bother me much.",

I really like having all of my prime services on my phone and it plays well with my fire TV. I have made good use of the Firefly feature on my phone and it works so well. I've used it to identify, music, movies, websites, and tv shows. The firefly feature is actually fun to use. Another feature I like is the photo locket, which is a quick gallery of sorts from your lock screen. Like a digital \"mom's brag book\".

The 3D feature that the cameras are for is kinda cool and novel and everything, but totally useless in reality, whereas a light is much cheaper than even 1 camera and way more useful. Also, stock applications like the built in email have a little number overlay to tell you how many new messages you have, which is useful because you don't have to actually open the application if there's nothing new, but unsupported aftermarket apps like gmail and hangouts don't do this. So if I miss the initial ringtone of a hangouts message, the only way to know I have a message is to unlock the phone and open hangouts. If I dont do this every few minutes it's very likely that I may miss important messages. Accepting that people like and use google apps or including a notification light wouldve solved this problem.

In android, there's a menu for enabling outside input devices and selecting a different keyboard through the settings. But on Fire you can't access this menu. After research, it's possible to change the default keyboard through adb and messing with the filesystem but this is way too involved for most users and even as an engineer, I don't care enough to pursue it. I'm also not thrilled with the lockscreen settings. On my android phone I was able to install an aftermarket lock screen that displays notifications so I dont have to unlock my phone to see what messages I have. This wouldve been especially useful for the Fire based on my complain #1 earlier, but alas, Fire OS doesn't allow you to disable the stock lockscreen so you essentially have to go through 2 lock screens if you install another one.

The Fire also won't connect to my Alpine car stereo to play music which is something all of my previous Android phones did without a hitch. And if you're used to android widgets you can say goodbye to them too. Fire OS has more of an iOS feel and Amazon went as far as deleting useful android features to make it more unique, rather than adding value by adding features.

I currently own a Surface Pro 3, iPad Air, Kindle Paperwhite, three MP3 players, three cameras and an LG phone.

Although I own the Nexus 6, I bought this to use as an ipod. I can watch anything on amazon and cast it to my tv set with the chromecast. Seemless Amazon integration and everything the androids do without an faults make it a great phone. I believe the paranoid set fears what they do not know.

The fact that it recognizes many of the product box makes it even ore convenient to get result as opposed to having to find a bar or QR code using my iPhone. The 3D mapping is also quite impressive because it adds depth to my searches, having yelp attached to the search is also an added bonus especially for  restaurants.

Even though the screen is 720p resolution it looks extremely good ( better than some 1080p screens ) battery is good at best. I found liking this phone more than I thought I would ( I'm sure the price and it being New and different from what I'm used to had something to do with it. ) I got really comfortable using the Fire's Phone UI. It feels 2nd nature after only a few hours of using it. Amazon's Appstore is ok. I prefer the Google Play Store. Loading time in the web browser was and felt faster than my HTC One M7.(same WiFi network)  I bought this phone as others did for the price, my Amazon prime membership was due this month, to use as an iPod, as a backup phone, and not to mention again I couldn't resist the price. I haven't really tested the camera so I won't comment. I'm really starting to feel the Fire Phone and thinking about putting my HTC One in the shelf ( at least for a while ) As I test this phone further. I'm sure I will begin missing my HTC and Android Google Apps and end up putting the Fire Phone in the box to be what it was intended to be ....... my backup phone.

The font size for the text messages seems small. You don't get a lot of customization with the phone and if that is something you must have stay away from this phone. The browser is fine. It gets you to web pages and I have played videos embedded in the browser with no problems. Prime Music and the Amazon Instant Videos play well on the phone. There is lack of bass from the speakers which is a downer. The headphones are okay if you are lucky enough to have them fit your ears. I was just happy to have them included as more companies are no longer doing so. Firefly is really helpful and fast. Dynamic Perspective is nice to look at for a few minutes but I would never buy the phone for it. Phone calls are clear and people tell me they hear me just fine and text messages go through fast. Battery life could and should be better with the size of this battery. I am a light to moderate user and it has to go on the charger every night. If I try to play games with the phone for even a short amount of time the battery drains really fast. I hope that Amazon does an update that will improve the battery life of the phone. I think this was a good first try for Amazon in phone design and build quality but they were delusional with the original $649 price they were asking for the phone. That is iPhone territory and they were the new kids on the block. Making it an AT&T exclusive was another bad idea.

The Samsung has a known bug with Kitkat 4.4+ which causes the phone to not recognize the SIM card and reboot constantly after any system or security update.  The surefire remedy was to back up the phone, restore factory settings and then restore your data.  (Sometimes clearing system cache worked -- sometimes, let me stress.)  Right, that's acceptable, isn't it?!  With Amazon, no bs with shipping, warranty and return.  It's faster than my Nexus 4 running Lollipop.  Also the battery life is about the same if not slightly longer.  I did turn off dynamic perspective and slow motion features since they weren't worth it to me -- and I wanted to save on battery life.  However, both worked fine.  I don't think the ability to use it with one hand is anything to sniff at if that is how you use your phone.  I haven't turned off location or auto-brightness.  Re auto brightness, I use it all the time outdoors.  It is amazingly bright in direct sunlight.  Frankly, it's pretty much a Kindle Fire that can dial.

I don't know why anybody who needs a phone wouldn't want it, especially since with Prime, in Atlanta that means I'm eligible for Prime Now, which is another great feature that I've been using alot lately for a menagerie of things, so yeah, I'd recommend this phone, doubly so if you get it at the sale price, around $180-$200 and get prime.",

I needed to get a little help from Net10 to properly set up the data plan, and now everything works well. I have a few minor issues with the phone- the side button for the camera/firefly is way to easy to hit by accident. I am not crazy about the home screen- I like to be able to see the time and battery charge as soon as I turn on my phone, and not having them is somewhat inconvenient. I also miss having a 'back' button- sliding up seems to do this in most programs, but it is not consistent in all cases.",

Also battery life wasn't so great,  very sad. I believe next version will be here to fight,  just make it more sleek and more customizable, better battery and you got a competitor!

I'm sure it does a lot more than most smart phone users today actually require.

The camera is outstanding.  It is so great that I bought my girlfriend one through her account for her because she cracked her Nexus 5 screen and it was a better deal to buy this phone than replace her screen (it was on a three day sale).  When you factor in you get a $100 Prime membership in, the phone becomes and is an exceptional value.  I read many of the reviews online and found them to be biased and inconsistent with my experience with this phone.  In the past five years I have owned 3 i-phones and 4 androids.  None of the androids compare.  Fire Phone leaves them in the dust.  As to I-Phone, this is heads a shoulders a better value than the $800 - $1200 unlocked I-Phones (especially considering how often people change phones).  I love Amazon products and applaud Jeff Bezos for jumping in.  For full disclosure, I own an I-Pad, an I-Pad Mini, a PC, a MacPro, a Kindle Voyage, (I have owned 9 other kindles which I have given as gifts to my family), I have owned a Kindle Fire which I gave to my niece, and I have owned 4 I-Phones (through the I-Phone 4).  I have had 3 LG Android Phones (disappointed in all of them), 1 Allcatel 5\" phone (I just bought it a month ago and was very disappointed).  So I do love Apple products, but find their phones to be extremely overpriced for the value.  I also love Amazon products having had all generations of the Kindle e-readers (and duplicates in some generations for gifts).  This phone is an outstanding value and has exceptional features you don't find anywhere else.  Go Amazon!  Keep it up with the great products.",

This definitely fits the bill; it was too good of a deal to pass up at the $200 price tag for an ulocked phone.  I purchased a $10 nano sim card at T-mobile and the phone was up and working no problem.  Very easy to import phone number contacts from gmail.  The 3-D effects on the lock screen are neat; not distracting; it would be nice if amazon offered brighter colored, happier themed scenes to download (many of the lock screen scenes look dim colored & a bit creepy).  The voice recognition for searching the internet and phone dailing works well/ very impressive.  Overall, much better than the unreliable Galaxy S Blaze that  I replaced.

Another plus are my kindle books can be read to me over Bluetooth and aloud. Pretty nifty huh? If you are interested do what I did. Order it! You'll have 30 days to try it and return if you aren't thrilled. I believe the price goes up to $450 again after cyber Monday. $200 for a high end phone plus a free year of Prime! And the sound blows my Samsung out of the water. Great phone! If you heard rumours that Amazon removed reviews they're false.

Adding every single recent app and book you read to the home screen is a design choice I do not particularly like. You can't even change the background! It takes a long press and another press to remove something from the Carousel, only to have it come back if you use that app again. The app screen is much like Apple in that organization is sort of a nightmare, and there is no auto-sorting of apps. Also, if you group apps into a folder (collection as Amazon calls it) you will need to remove every app from that folder in order to get rid of the collection.",

However, their OS is tragically behind in feature set and aesthetics from all other phone OS on the market (I'm including Windows Phone and Ubuntu Phone OS in this comparison.) I personally believe \"Dynamic Perspective\" is a gimmick which added unnecessary cost to the phone, some of Amazon's apps make use of the motion gestures well, but swiping is still my preferred (and I think more logical) way to access menus, additional options, etc. Plus, adding a 3D effect to text just makes it look blurry. It's a decent effect whose novelty wears off within an hour of using the phone, so essentially it's pretty useless. Another gripe are the lock screens, while they look nice with dynamic perspective, I can perceive a delay between pressing the power button and seeing the lock screen/ being able to unlock. It's not a show-stopper, but it is jarring from a user perspective.",

I don't care if a bazillion people have them or not. Fire OS is purely fantastic. And I love the orange on black on my keyboard. Just little things and big obvious ones like Mayday just make this special. Dynamic Perspective isn't such a gimmick. I actually use it to peek behind things or see more like street names on the map app. Amazon's software devs are really doing us all a great service and I am proud to show off this thing everywhere I go. People never walk away without saying something like \"OKAY... now THAT is a neat feature\"... motion sickness on dynamic perspective? That's Crap. My wife is the worst motion sickness person and she loves the 3D and wallpapers and it doesn't make her sick. My favorite part is when I put the device on a table and tell someone to move their head. With a dynamic wallpaper up, they always smile and think it's neat what they see without having to move the phone. Most people actually overdo it at first and look at it like at a 45 degree angle but that's completely unnecessary and I like how it works both in my hand or on my desk. Perfect size and nothing us \"overdone\" or \"too flashy\" and coming from a multi-gen iPhone user, trust me this means a lot. I never really liked the intricacies of Android OS, and I feel Amazon hit a sweet spot. They made those android annoyances much better, and added features i prefer that Android simply doesn't \"feel\" quite finished to me like fire os does. Switching from iPhone to this was a breeze. I cognizantly closed my Verizon account just so I could get this and I'm glad I did. I am even writing this review on mine. :) And I'm an I.T. guy so I do know a thing or two. :)",

It does not, however, stand above any other smart phone that is out there. It carries many of the same features as other smart phones and works quite similarly to other smart phones available today, so it is basically in line with other smart phones of its class. I like it because I enjoy the Amazon ecosystem. The phone is certainly geared toward those who enjoy Amazon and its services. If that isn't you, you may not enjoy this phone. I upgraded to this from an older Android model (Galaxy S), and I do admit there are features of Android that I miss, such as multiple home screens and the ability to make folders for organization, but those are features I can live without. The camera on this phone is fast, takes nice pictures, has a flash, and comes with features found on many camera systems for taking better pictures; the Firefly feature on this phone is pretty cool; and the browser works well when perusing the Internet. I bought two of these phones when Amazon ran their deal for this phone, a case, and a year of Prime for $189; so technically, the phone cost $89, since I would have renewed my Prime membership anyway, and it's better and faster than the Galaxy S I had which cost me over $500 at the time of purchase. That's a good deal - and the phone is unlocked. I use T-Mobile and the only extra cost for me was to purchase a micro SD card for $10 because my previous phone used a standard SD card, making it non-transferable. No biggie.",

For instance, if you're holding your phone in your hand with your arm extended away from you and you tilt your wrist to use a DP feature, such as to make the left or right screen appear, the screen may not appear because the phone isn't lined up with your face to be aware that it's being tilted. It doesn't work like other systems that use gyroscope sensors where the phone detects tilting just by tilting it, this phone's cameras must see your face for the DP to work. This isn't a complaint, rather a simple FYI for people interested in the phone. Hope this helps.",

As I'm already a Prime member, I wondered how that would play out. Amazon just extended my membership for an entire year from when my current membership would have expired. I'm still acquainting myself with the phone. I have used the Mayday function twice. I was a little scared and somewhat hesitant to use Mayday the first time, but by the second time I felt really comfortable. You can see the Mayday rep but they cannot see you, only your phone, which is probably a good thing because as frazzled as I was, I must have looked, well in my mind I'm thinking Edward Scissorhands-ish, lol! Both times I used Mayday it was related to the same issue. My issue was resolved with the second Mayday contact. And in case any of you might have the same problem in the future that I was having, you probably don't want to put a screen protector on the gorilla glass, as apparently it interrupts some sort of function, or contact, when you're using the phone to make calls.  When I would dial a number and hit connect, my screen would go black. I wouldn't be able to get a keypad or get the screen back to disconnect the call.  Once I removed the screen protector, as suggested by the Mayday rep, my problem was resolved. Apparently, the glass is quite strong and it would take a lot to scratch it.  I have put Pandora as well as the Fitbit app on my phone, and both of these seem to work nicely. I've been using an android device to this point, and this phone is a little bit different than that. Do not...I repeat...do not look for the back button! I feel like with time and an open mind (I tend to get really frustrated each time I get a new phone), I might be able to give the phone a solid 5 stars instead of 4. I'm no techie, but the phone appears to be well-built and so far is working quite nicely. I don't use it heavily, so the battery lasts all day for me. I haven't used the camera much yet or the Maps app, so I don't really have an opinion on them.",

Mind you all, it can still be quite expensive, especially if, as for me, this really IS a phone, for emergencies only, or finding, in a hurry, the train station in Heidelberg or La Spezia.  Thus, never mind the smartness which surely is there behind the shiny, onyx-black glass screen, and call me a dinosaur, but I REALLY do all I can to free myself from the unbreakable phone-call tether, idiotical and insignificant text messages that everybody around me insists on sending, moronic twits, and other people's grinning faces on Facebook that I try to forget (and not always can). In short, when I need you, I will get to you unfailingly using my Fire Phone. And when YOU need me, I can be, actually, found without too much trouble and called using the selfsame Fire Phone (or any other one for that matter.) Thus, since we now know our mutual social needs can be readily satisfied, whatever else this little, elegant thing does in terms of apps, saving the universe from itself, or increasing the intellectual capacity of Helix pomatia pedal ganglion, is beyond my ability to review, analyze, or assess.  But I can tell you that much: when I needed a taxi in France, at a spot where NOTHING worked, the Fire phone and its T-Mobile soul did not fail me.  I managed to catch my TGV, get to the airport on time, and get back home.  THAT, friends, counts a lot in MY book, especially that on a previous occasion my GSM flip phone could not get hold of the local network at all.  The rest - the fancy lock-screens with aerobatic airplanes that Fire Phone has, the 3D picture of Seattle's \"neeedle\", or the unlimited, free cloud storage,  plus a few other concepts like Firefly or lenticular photos that MAY, actually, become quite useful if developed further (will they?) are at present nothing but battery sapping figments of techno-passion.  One potentially serious issue: the battery power.  Be judicious, and you will get a full day's work out of it.

Dynamic Perspective would have so much more attraction for developers if it were 1) more robust with support for a wider range of use cases and 2) a feature on a broader range of devices. I do not mean to be insulting to anyone who was involved in the Dynamic Perspective design process, but I have read that the developers could not figure out what to do with it and I suspect that was because the mission statement was 3D, which is but a single domain of possibilities for the hardware and API.

I take print magazines and newspapers on the toilet and a pocket knife or scissors for clipping the interesting parts out.

Most people carry chargers and portable ones are available. One thing some people who use my phone don't like is that the camera flips selfies so I sometimes flip them back. This doesn't get 5 stars only because It's not perfect. But for anyone who nows how to get around on android its fine. Any app you want can be installed somehow. The interface is a little bumpy but its a great simple layout I just hope more software updates come out since the phone has been out for a while. Within 3 days I was adjusted and using fire like a pro. I wish it had smoother features like flicking left to go to the inbox when you're texting, but these are little things. There are plenty of cool features like Mayday which I've used more often than I thought I would have, firefly, and the wrist flick stuff. This is definitely not the worst phone of 2014, maybe overpriced. But for this price It's worth it and it comes with prime. The camera is a little slow but it's still really good. I took it to a concert and my friends with iPhones picture look pixel-y when they send them to me but the picture i took look great on the fire and social media so it doesn't even matter. Dynamic perspective doesn't get in the way, it's cool, and can be turned off. The phone feels sturdy and its got lots of great features that you'll actually find yourself using.",

Finally this week when price dropped again I pulled the trigger and VERY glad I did.  I won't bore you with many details already noted by others, but took me 2 mins total to side-load google play, and then all operations from that point on was as if this was just another android OS phone.  Thanks to another user for including link to side-loading steps.  Every single google play app I installed I was expecting maybe this is where it will have issue.  NONE!  I have installed about 20 apps, and NONE had issue installing, configuring, or running so far.  I have the following google apps working without a glitch: maps, voice, \"ok google\" search widget, calendar, contacts, hangouts, chrome, chrome beta.  Here are other apps I installed and working without issues: Evernote, TouchDown, IP Cam Viewer Pro, 1Password, Uber, Waze, RunKeeper, ChargePoint, WhatsApp, Chamberlain, Pebble, Dislock, etc., etc.",

Don't get me started on the free 2 day shipping now, lol. The scrolling to read while tilting the phone feature is unique and so is dynamic perspective (a little gimmicky but nice).  The speakers are loud, articulate and great. I love being able to have my books in my pocket and whip this baby out to read my books during my breaks at the J.O.B.

I have had prime for a few years now and with the Fire phone being able to store pictures and videos on the amazon cloud is plus as is having the phone set to your account when it arrives.

Gestures, peek, and autoscroll just to name a few. Plus, it adds a lot of fun to the device. The lock screens are creative and look nice. I find myself turning it on just to look at my lock screen. The ecosystem is pretty good too. It doesn't have some apps, but the complaints about no Google apps crack me up. Once you add your email, it sync all your Google contacts, Google calendar, and gmail information. Plus, you can sideload the Google play store. The Fire Phone's camera is amazing. It takes great pictures and recommends you when to us HDR. The camera button is a good addition. For the price, you can't find a device with these kind of specs. I would recommend to anyone.",

Would be nice to be able to customize the text message background as well.. I was also kinda disappointed that the Sleepy Time app which I had purchased off of Amazon and used on my other Android phones without any issues was not working properly, it would only play the sound for 1-5 mins, then no sound but you could see the timer running?

With that said it's good at what it does for that price. I bought this for my wife as a replacement for her nexus 4. She is a really small woman with small hands and it gets harder to find a good smallish phone now a days. She does not like change so the move to the fire os did not go well just as I had imagined. But I am very tech savvy and knew this going in so I did root the phone and install the Google play store and launcher (root is not even need for this) and just like that it went from being the worst phone she had ever used to the best phone she has ever used. Her requirements for a good phone are very responsible as she only wants good speakers for when she is listening to YouTube without head phones (stereo speakers), a good camera(13mp with optical image stabilization), and no hiccups while using the phone(snapdragon 800 with 2gb ram). Check on all those marks. Now I will give my opinion as I am more of a power user myself and spoil myself with the latest specs. This phone is not the best at pretty much anything but it is good at everything. Fire OS is a big departure from stock android and takes a lot of getting use to just because all the simple things you know need to be relearned. Now all those cameras on the front...there useless in my opinion. Unfortunate because I think they are it's only differentiator From other maybe better choices on the market. So to rap this up if you are thinking of getting this for someone who is used to android just install the Google play store and services and they will probably love this phone but I must emphasize This phone is a good choice at the special lower price not full retail. Not to knock the fire phone but for full price there are just too many other and better phone's out there.",

I heard there was a software update the help improve battery life, but my Fire Phone had the software update before I started testing the battery performance.  However, in defense of the Fire Phone, the poor battery performance that I'm experiencing might have something to do with the phone sitting in storage for many many months too long.  When the Fire Phone arrived, I gave it a full charge before I turned it \"On\" for the first time.  During that initial charge, it took about 15 minutes for the batter to charge from 0% to 1%, so the Fire Phone arrived on my door step with a battery that was neglected & completely depleted and in the early stages of chemically self-destructing.  My first couple battery refresh cycles (100% to 0% \"auto shut-off\" and back to 100%), the battery only lasted 4 to 5 hours, for my normal usage (During the day I usually use my Smart Phone to stream music 2+ hours, send 20+ text messaged, send an occasional email, check stock news, check online deals, research info or maps a few times, stream 1 or 2 YouTube videos, might stream a 30 to 60 minute TV show on Hulu Plus, might play a leisure game or 2).  After a few more complete battery refresh cycles, the battery now lasts 8 to 10 hours, for my normal usage.  That sounds good, but I'm at work for 9 hours each day, and if I leave home with my Fire Phone fully charged (100%), it is nearly dead by the time I get off work. Also, keep in mind that at 8 to 10 hours battery life, the Fire Phone's battery is performing a little over 1/2 (half) that of the battery performance of my Samsung smart phones (Note 2 and S2) when they were new.  (I recently learned that the iPhone 5 batteries don't perform nearly as well at the Samsung Smart Phones, so if you're an older iPhone user, you might not be disappointing by the Fire Phone's battery.)",

I'm sure they're still missing, I just found out that they weren't as essential as I thought.",

Purchase the phone through Amazon, and then take the delivered phone into your local Cricket Wireless store to fire up the Nano SIM and select your data plan. I like it. Any takers for a Samsung Galaxy 4 legacy CDMA phone in excellent condition? Max rebate via Cricket Wireless is $120 only if you purchase a very expensive GSM replacement phone.

Siri is the one reason I stuck with the Iphone. It recognized asian names much better for example. Siri could not recognize half of the asian names on my contacts but Fire Phone did all of them. However this voice recognition is limited to email, text, navigation, calendar and contacts. To get the other voice recognition feature, I downloaded Assistant (by Speak to it) from amazon app store and it can do everything else Siri does and better. It can translate to any language unlike Siri. In 5 minutes I was able to tweak it to be able download Android apps from Googleplay (http://www.yourbountyhunter.org/firephone/). The sound is superior to any other phone I tried. It has 2 speakers rather than the one on Iphone and can do very crisp virtual surround. I found that out streaming from netflix. So far, camera looks very comparable to Iphone 5S. Interface is very much like Iphone. The battery does drain fast due to 5 cameras in front. So I basically have an Iphone and Kindle wrapped in one. Match made in heaven. Next big test is to see if it works with smartwatch. Since I can use android apps, I assume it can.",

I'm a iphone 5 user and I was in love with the amazon fire, so I bought it with the idea to change my iphone, but now I will not. The phone looks perfect on picture, but after it arrived, it just has been blocking and reseting by itself when I tried to use it at its full. I can not use the function of firefly or dynamics perspective because the phone died, literally gone dead, I have to start rebooting it over and over again until finally I can unlock the screen and quickly go and desactivate all the function that requires to many resources. If I use the phone like a basic one for texting, calling and  receive email, it is ok, but for a phone that it cost so much and has so many function it should work ok when using them. I'm in Venezuela so I can not return it but I would if I could do it. I love amazon, I have had a paperwhite kindle for about 3 years and I thought I would have a good experience with the phone. At the moment I wrote this review my phone is dead, I've been trying rebooting it but it keep resetting itself, all of this because I activated dynamics perspective one more time to see if it worked.

So far, the positives are the Camera, Dynamic Perspective is cool (useless for a utilitarian like me) and voice call is an improvement from the S4.  It feels like a solid device in your hand and feels secure to hold.  For the bad, the \"go-back\" gesture for Fire (swipe up at the bottom of the screen) always gets in the way of normal motions like just scrolling and you'd end up going back to previous window.  When you install app, it doesn't fill a the full panel before going the next, although you can always manually re-arrange.  I haven't figured out if there is an option to quickly rearrange the apps to say alphabetical.  I've always used shortcuts, I wish that there is a speed dial on this thing(not sure if I can get an equivalent app) - little feature that makes it dialing say your home or a special one with a single press of a number. Another thing I've noticed is that in call/message the device does not somehow capture your area code in a way that if you stored a number with an area code (it's useful when you go to another area under another area code) and somebody sends you a message in the same area code, it wouldn't automatically use the contacts, it will show the person's number instead like it wasn't in your contacts.  In a message, you cannot directly call the person sending you a message, it goes through contacts first and then make the call.  I hope this small improvement comes out on the next update (main reason why Im doing this review).",

Point it at a sign or a business card and you can easily save email address and phone numbers to your contacts.",

The only issue I have with it is that it is locked down far too tight. Let us legitimately install the Google Play store. I know the Amazon app store is supposed to drum up business for Amazon to help pay for the R&D etc. of the Fire Phone but without essential apps that aren't on the Amazon store such as a very basic one like the official YouTube app the phone will always be at a disadvantage to it's less restrictive competitors. Let us customize Fire OS to our taste, It's not that the Amazon keyboard is bad, but I am used to using Swiftkey X and the Fire Phone is perfectly capable of running it but I cannot install it without an unofficial work-around. The carousel icons are too big for my taste, let me make them smaller and add another row of dock icons. Lastly, please follow HTC's lead and provide a bootloader unlock tool, we don't care if you put in the fine print that it will void the warranty, we want to tinker.

If you already own devices within the Kindle environment, this is a no-brainer choice at this price point. UI was easily learned and the camera is great. Gmail account carried over with no issues. The only issues involved have to do with bringing it to the carrier of choice, in my case Straight Talk. If you go this route, be aware that you will lose your local environment, meaning that you will need to enter the area code for all calls made. No big deal if most calls are from your contact list. The other carrier issue is one of native tower selection. You may end up with less connectivity if say you were on a strong Verizon service area and now you are on the weaker AT&T tower network because of the nano SIM GSM setup that the carrier requires for this phone. A true test of this will be the next time I go to the western North Carolina mountains where the only good service is on Verizon phones.",

If your not big into apps then this phone will be awesome, but if your heavily involved in the Android or ios app store, then it will kind of suck switching to this phone. If this had all the same apps as Android it would probably be my favorite phone out right now. I'm not going to lie, I do like this phone a lot, but if the app store was better I would absolutely LOVE it!! I consider this the Almost Perfect Phone. In my opinion the One Plus One is the Perfect phone. The is my 3rd favorite phone behind the One Plus One (Beastly specs at an affordable price) and the Nexus (only because I LOVE Stock android). Like I said before I consider the Fire Phone to be the Almost Perfect Phone for 2014.",

The phone camera could be better as most of indoor our low light photos I took turned out to be below standard.

My favorite apps were unavailable on the fire phone. These were inconveniences, but no backlight on the screen and a screen that freezes is a fatal flaw.

All I have to do is hold the button down, say \"call ------\", and the next thing I know, I am speaking to the person I wanted to call, without ever having to look at the phone.

Granted, I've only been using it for a week or so now, but it's everything I would hope for and more in a smartphone. It has a fantastic camera, runs smoothly and quickly, and has a very clean, easy-to-use layout and navigation. I think many of the negative reviews are coming from people who didn't do their research ahead of time and came out disappointed. So to address some of the complaints I saw - 1) It is possible to side load Google Play apps, and I set it up in a matter of minutes. There are various ways to do this and you have to make some adjustments to the settings to avoid issues, but it works surprisingly well. 2) Yes, battery life could be better, but there are some things you can do to make the most of it. I text, call, use apps, and play music at various points throughout the day, and my battery generally last a full day or more. Install a battery saver app and disable or close things that are unnecessarily running in the background, as this takes up major battery life. Put your phone on a power saving mode or shut it off during the night. 3) Get the unlocked version of the phone. This is more personal choice than anything else, but if you're like me and hate being in contracts, stick to the unlocked phones with no-contract plans. 4) I saw complaints about Amazon's way of navigating through menus, etc. and the lack of a back button. The phone very clearly runs you through a tutorial on startup to show you how to use the features, and it's extremely easy. No, it doesn't have a back \"button\", but all you have to do is swipe up in the bottom left to go back. Flick the phone to the right or left to open side menus, and tilt it slightly to use \"peek\". It's really not that hard and it works well. Plus, if you really hate it, you can change it in the settings under \"device -> manage accessibility -> motion and gestures settings\".",

But Amazon chose not to run the google play store in addition to their own app store.  The play store and google structures can be added via side loading with only a quick YouTube how to search and 5-15 minutes of your time. But not everyone will want to perform this procedure or will feel incapable of it, so if that is you and you also like having a wide variety of apps go look at androids or iPhones.  I had accepted the limitations of the Amazon app store prior to purchase so I did not remove a star as this phone was not meant to be competitive with android or Apple on that level.

Both our phones are off contract and after a fiasco with a major cell service provider we had determined not to go back to one which brought price into play.  I did not want to suffer a major downgrade in performance but also did not want to pay $400-$700 for one of the leading smart phones.  I saw the price had been slashed on the fire phone and had previously had a interest in it so I started to take a better look.  The obvious OS difference aside I began to look at how the hardware stacked up.  Each phone has its own perks but the core stats (processor, ram, graphics, screen size, camera) was what I wanted to compare.  I will not pretend the fire phone was the best, but I compared it to iphone 5s and 6, galaxy s5, and the moto X.  All of which were phones I was considering if I couldn't find a reasonably priced alternative.  The fire phone stacked up as better specs than at least two of those and still competitive though not as good against others... which to be fair the other 4 phones I had pitted against the fire phone all sit in a $400-$700 price bracket compared to the $200 for the fire phone.  That was when I was convinced to try it.",

The firefly button is effective and useful, and the 3d screen option fun although in and of itself useless.  The camera was a larger step up from the iphone.  The phone is designed for media consumption much like the fire tablets and it excels at that including a rather enjoyable speaker for music (rare in a phone).  The OS seems to model the iOS more than android, but there is a steep learning curve when adjusting settings and not much is intuitive about adjusting settings often finding the settings you want in a seemingly unrelated section and then the setting is more clumsy then you would really like it to be.  I still have not finished setting the phone up the way I want to. But overall I can't complain and am enjoying my phone.  I removed one star for the counter intuitive settings adjustment.  With sideloading google play it does run android apps just fine.  In conclusion if you don't mind tinkering a little it definitely seems to be the best bang for the buck.",

I have included the reference numbers because available functions may change, or have been changed.  The Amazon FIre Phone arrived on the scene to lukewarm reviews.  I don't really understand why that was the case  After reading many reviews, I have concluded that the current Fire Phone is different differs from the first release.  Although there is no official \"version 2.0\" mentioned by Amazon - something HAS changed.  I believe a firmware change has been implemented - giving it more functionality.  Rather than listing what the phone will do, you can check it out on the Amazon website.  My daughter's family members (five of them) all use iPhones.  I have had hands-on experience with the iPhones, and can tell you the Amazon Fire Phone is a much better device.  The biggest shortcoming I can find with the Fire Phone is that it doesn't accept a micro-sd card.  BUT, neither does the iPhone.  There is talk that the Fire Phone will support additional memory using a USB OTG cable and a thumb drive.  I own three USB OTG cables and none of them work in this capacity.  There is a cable that the seller claims to have been made exclusively for the FIre Phone.  I am waiting to get one of the cables and will put it to the test.  I will update this review after testing the cable.  One thing I don't like is the shorter-than-advertised battery life.  I think the  (always-on) GPS is the battery hogging culprit. It's on even when no GPS-using apps are running (in the foreground).  Disabling all apps that CAN use the GPS, does turn it off - but turning it back on when needed with an app is very inconvenient.",

The camera on this phone way surpasses that. The only other phone camera that supposedly beats it, is that of the iPhone. Needless to say, it works well enough for me.

I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy S2 through straight talk and was looking for a halfway decent upgrade at a good price. What I ended up getting was the BEST DAMN PHONE ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!! Don't get me wrong there was some growing pains at first trying to switch from and android interface to the Fire OS. The best way I can describe it is the user interface similar to an IPhone with all the awesomeness of an android with apps and ease of access. Once you get used to how everything works you will fly around your phone like it's second nature. I also purchased one of these for my mom who is a little technologically challenged. She found everything easy to use and navigate right away. I prefer to tweak things a little more so I had more digging to do than she did. Just look at all it has to offer for hardware and then try to find something comparable for the price that is new.....I promise you won't....at least not without a contract. Truly people this is a no brainer. One of my favorite things about the Fire OS is that the battery lasts a long time as long as your not playing games or watching movies....but your battery will die faster on any phone if you're watching a lot of media. The Fire OS seems to not let all the B.S. programs run in the background like the Android does so that in itself will increase battery life 3 fold. So, My final word is BUY THIS PHONE but know it will take a little bit to get used to the interface. If you can accept that then I promise you will love this phone as much as I do. :D",

It has a nice size screen and the screensavers/locked screen pictures \"react\" as you move the phone and change daily (about 30 different pictures).  It also take great photos. I'm a moderate smart phone user. I like to take some pictures, some short videos of the kiddos, use the gps, research locations and simple facts, check my email occasionally and of course text. I am certain that I text more than I talk on the phone like many of you. At this point I only have 3 points of criticism. The volume for speaking to people and hearing people on the phone is not loud enough. I pretty much can't use the speaker aspect of the phone. It just isn't loud enough. It's definitely a no go in the car. (My cabin is too noisy.) As far as I can tell, I have it set at its highest level in phone settings. The battery life could be a little better but this may be a user error. I may need to see what I can turn off so it won't be so draining on the battery. The voice recognition is not so hot either. I had an old Samsung Exhibit and it was much better at picking up my voice activated texts than this Fire. I don't know if the Fire phone is just too sensitive but it really makes a mess of like half of my texts messages. I really have to proof read them before I send them. Overall, I think I got a great phone for $200 (on sale). I would definitely advise Amazon to work on the volume and voice recognition. This phone was a step up for me coming from a 3 year old plus Exhibit. However, it might be a step down for an Iphone or Samsung  Galaxy user.",

It does weigh a little more, but to me it seems more of a pro than a con. First, the cons: There are some nice features, but there are some noticeable missing features that will hopefully come with time. One of the more noticeable missing feature is lack of printing capability. I need to use a 3rd party app to print anything. I also miss the icon notification badges that tell you when there is an update. I do however like the fact that if I can't find an app on the Amazon app-store, I can side-load a Google Play app and it works just fine. It has some work to do on the voice command options versus the iPhone, but maybe that will improve when the Amazon Echo is released. Now, some pros: The camera is actually better and has more built-in features than its iPhone counterpart. It has double the storage space than my previous phones. The picture quality on videos is much better than my iPhone 5 was. The battery life is MUCH better than my iPhone's battery and I have the bluetooth running all day with my Pebble watch. Overall, I would definitely say that it was worth every penny I spent. I don't feel like I overpaid for this phone like I would have if I bought another iPhone. Especially since I got this on sale for $199 with a year of Prime, making it a no-brainer for $100. I don't know if I would have spent $449 on it, but if it ever goes on sale again, I would definitely recommend it at the $200 price point.",

I am on my third Kindle and have the Fire TV Stick as well.  The MAYDAY folks assisted me with the carousel and it is no longer a problem.  I do wish I had GASBUDDY and TMOBILE and WALMART Apps, but continuing to work those issues. I would recommend this phone if you are not the technical type, do not need access to many APPS and want a great phone for call quality and voice quality... the reason to buy a phone in the first place.  Love the call quality on this phone more than on any other Smart phone I have had.  My battery life is better than the HTC One S that only lasted a day MAX without any but minimal use. This one, I can go about 2 days, but I am busy testing it out so not really sure just how long it will last with limited use.  Texting is good also. I have not had any problems as some have indicated.  Sometimes I do get frustrated, but I think that is the learning curve.  I have 3 more weeks of testing and using to finally determine if I will keep it.  Right now it is a definite yes.  And, I love the heft and the looks.",

I have had IPhones up until the Samsung galaxy s4 active came out and I never thought I'd look at anything else because I loved it so much.  However the special offer of $199 came up with a free year of Prime and I thought I'd try it.  I don't know why people are giving it such bad reviews I love this phone.  Yes it operates different from the iPhone or galaxy but I like the difference especially the swipe up feature as a back key.  The tilt features are really nice as well.  It fits in my hand so much more comfortably than the galaxy did even though it's heavier.  The Amazon app store doesn't have some apps that I need for work so I just sideloaded Google play store with a few simple steps and now I have everything I need.  I wouldn't have bought it had it not been onsale. .you can't beat basically getting a new phone with this caliber of specs for $100 unlocked since Prime is already $99.  It is fast and takes great pictures.  I went to  AT&T and got a free nano SIM card then I had to download the AT&T transfer app on it and my old phone and I was able to move videos, pictures, texts, contacts, music etc. To my new Fire.

I have T-Mobile, but didn't have that issues before switching phones. I also noticed it has been challenging trying to get used to its functions since they are way different from any other android type phones.  I also noticed I have less options in terms of apps to download. For instance my bank doesn't offer a banking app for the fire phone. The platform is so different and not as mainstream so sometimes it feels like being left out of some cool things.  Facebook is fine but I hate the instagram app for the fire phone. For the price, I can't complain, I so wasn't going to shell out $700+ for a new Galaxy or iPhone. I've only had the phone a couple of weeks and am starting to get used to it, it is just taking longer than expected.  Call quality is great, the text functions are easy and there are cool graphics, but not much in way of ring tones and such. Overall it is OK for my needs but if you use your phone for everything and are really tech savvy, I wouldn't recommend. However, if you just need to call, text or other minimal tasks, for the price you can't beat it, especially for an unlocked phone. On another note, my husband loves it and he has caught on how to use it much more quickly than I have.",

A better solution might be to initiate when the phone is shaken.  This should be no problem to enable since the phone has accelerometers.  Another problem is accidental activation of the camera button.  There should be a settings item to allow the button to be disabled.  The tilt and swivel features are useful.  The phone has no provisions to open to change a battery.  The SIM card is nano and must be inserted from the side using a pin tool to extract a tray that could be easily lost.

No, it is not the  64 G phone, but is the 32, but compared to my 64 Fire, it is just as fast.  I do not plan on downloading movies or books on it to see and read, so that might make a difference in the speed.  I like it that you can find out exactly what is taking up space in the phone, as far as size of the application, goes, so if it gets overloaded, you know where to go to clean it out.  Mine arrived with a scratch on the protective screen, but rather than make a big deal out of it, I kept it. I figure it will get more scratches later on, anyway.  I did buy the additional protective screen for it, though.  I think this was a return, as it was not packaged as it would have been had it come directly from the factory...in a tightly wrapped cellophane bag....it was just \"in\" the lose bag.  I have a year before the warranty runs out, so we shall wait and see if there is anything really wrong.  However, I really do love it!  I give it 5 stars.",

But I love my Kindle and took the jump and bought two for my husband and myself when Amazon put the Fire on sale. I have been using it for a few days now, and it is, hands down, the nicest phone I have owned. It has a great feel in the hand, has a beautiful display. It is fast, smooth, and intuitive. The special features work nicely (Firefly, Dynamic Perspective) and the camera is AWESOME. I love the security of having Mayday available and already used it when my husband jammed his SIM card holder and  we got immediate help. It's not perfect- battery life is only fair and I wonder how long the battery will last since it is not replaceable, and that SIM card holder is silly touchy, but I couldn't be happier with this phone and feel it would have been a good buy without the sale! With their debut phone this thoughtfully made,  I suspect that Amazon will be a huge name in phones!",

And a prime membership is the best value for your dollar anywhere with movies tv shows , prime music and you can borrow books.  But the very best is free 2 day shipping on many products you can buy on Amazon.  Also this phone has 32gb of storage you can download many of the prime movies and tv shows and watch off line.  And prime music has over a million songs something for everyone and with that much storage you have plenty of room for everything. And did I mention mayday help right on your phone when you need it. There are some fun features such as firefly .  But the real value is a beautiful smart phone thats one of the best at a great price. Thank you Amazon for another great product",

At first I was frustrated with the new features such as automatic scroll and gesture related menu commands. I even temporarily switched back to my Samsung S3 for a month just to give me time to re-evaluate my purchase. Then I started to realize everything that the Fire phone offered that was part of the package. I get a year of Prime, a $99.00 value, I get unlimited cloud space for my photos (now over 8 gigs).  I just bought my second Fire phone ($180.00 for unlocked 32 gig smart phone includes another year of prime. Net for the phone $80.00.). I use Pandora, but with Prime I get hundreds of free online music albums with Amazon music app. I use the Kindle app everywhere to read books from Amazon as well as books from other sources. There are a lot of frustrated Apple phone people that want to tear the Fire phone down. Don't pay attention to them. Maker up your own mind. This phone is the best smart phone purchase I ever made and I used to have an Iphone as well as an android phone.",

I bought this phone so I could get a high end phone for only $200.00 and then I dropped my ATT service and went with Cricket which is owned by ATT, so, you get their whole network and coverage anyways and it's 1/2 the price.  I pay $35.00 a month including all fees and taxes (with auto pay) and I get unlimited talk, unlimited text and 1 gig of high speed data.  If I go over my 1 gig of high speed, I still get data at no charge, I just get a slower speed.  This same plan would cost over $70.00 on ATT.  Yes, you can get this same phone for free on ATT with a contract, but if I amortize the cost over 24 months, the average length we keep our phones, then it's costing me an additional $8.00 a month.  Still, the $43.00 with taxes and fees included beats ATT at over $70.00 a month.  I don't know why anyone would use the major carriers service anymore.",

Thus far almost every app I used on the iPhone is on the amazon market except 2(business hasn't finished making the app). I am pleased with the phone, the same features except they made it their own. Bonus it comes with amazon prime which has a lot of bonuses to that alone. I have had no issues with the software or hardware. Funny things is the hardware is better on this than the iPhone 5.

I am not a heavy user...but fortunately am learning all of the ways that this phone can be useful and it is fairly user friendly. I would rate it higher if I could compare it to other similar phones. As a novice, I can honestly say that the phone is easy to use, has great spund from speakers, good connectivity, great graphics. Calls are clear. I use the unlocked version with my family mobile plan from walmart.  The nano sim cost $25. The phone cost me $189 & I received a free year of Amazon Prime, which I would have paid for anyway. My sweetheart went to a different phone company. He got a very nice phone but it coat him over $400 to walk out the door with it. His monthly bill is twice mine. So all in all, I can say that I am very happy with my decision to go with the unlocked fire phone. Good phone, good price and the freedom to ues this phone with plan that works for me add up a great deal. Happy customer here\ud83d\ude0a",

The screen on my Fire shattered after a rather minor slip out of my hand in the car as I was using the map function to navigate. It had been handled far worse by my kids, but this time (despite being in a protective case) must have fell at an awkward angle.  Amazon refused to replace it free of charge though I believe this is clearly a fault of the design -- and I seriously must be one of Amazon's best lifetime customers.  Amazon's touted new smartphone should be more durrable, and customer support more generous since this phone IS exactly what other reviewers have said it is -- A DEVICE FOR SELLING AMAZON CONTENT.

I even read it was considered a flop in the Tech world but after a lot of comparisons I decided to make my own judgement based on the knowledge of quality Amazon puts into their products and they are quick to assist any problems.  I can say for me it's an awesome phone, very surprised at how nice it is.  Takes wonderful pictures also.  The only drawback is google play not being accessible, but I think this can be utilized with some help from May Day.

The phone is comfortable to use when making calls or working with the hundreds of very useful apps available.  It gives the iPhone 6 a real run for its money; and what's nice is that the Fire Phone does not bend into an arc like the iPhone does; that can't be good for that phone!  Purchasing the unlocked phone allowed me to activate it and use it on any GSM network.  My choice was to continue with Consumer Cellular (who utilizes the AT&T network in my area) who readily accepts this unlocked Fire Phone. They will send to you immediately (within 2 days) the needed Nano Sim card.  I was able to seamlessly continue using my Consumer Cellular account (although very easy to set up a new account; no contract, can easily change phone and data plan to suit your use of the Fire Phone without penalty.  I will write more later and add to this review. You won't regret purchasing this phone.",

Phone is fast, good camera, does everything you need it to if you aren't dying without being in Android or Apple ecosystem. For those that use Prime or Amazon cloud services it is awesome. There are certainly some things that need to be cleaned up and it needs a good virtual assistant like Siri. It does have one but limited functionality.  Maybe Alexa from the Echo can be integrated into the phone at some point. Mayday is awesome. I have had an iPhone for 7 years and an Android tablet. If you are looking to surf the net, make phone calls, listen to music, watch vids, text message, and take pictures and videos.......this phone is a steal at this price. I hope Amazon listens to feedback for the Fire Phone 2.",

There is a tool to remove the sim card tray that is about useless. It took me a while to get the sim to work I used the Amazon help live video. They didn't know how to install the sim either. The tech person was going to send me a new phone but that wasn't the problem. I had to double and triple look to get the sim in the phone properly. I hope Amazon puts a better set on instructions in the box with the phone. There are none now. This phone isn't worth the full price $449 but I paid $229 with a year of prime. It is worth $130.",

Lack of ability to use an external sd card is a downfall too.  If I wanted an iPhone I would've just bought one instead.  Battery life is lower than it should be.  At this point the only feature that's really catchy is the Dynamic Perspective and there's hardly any apps made yet to even utilize that feature, mainly because developers don't want to be limited from using Google related programs.

My phone is the unlocked version that I use with T-Mobile and have never had any issue with texting, streaming or phone calls.  The voice recognition works waaaaay better than my old Samsung phone.  When I press my Bluetooth and say call home (or whomever), it actually works every time.  Very satisfied with my purchase!!!",

This phone has solid build quality, the screen is nice, takes good pictures, crystal clear calls (I'm using it on cricket by the way.) and the LTE is true to its name. This phone does have some set backs however. The biggest one being no Google Play store, Amazon uses its own app store. This is not a big deal for me as most of the apps i use Amazon had available. I see the price for the phone was set back to 450. At 450 i give the phone 3 stars. This review is based on what i bought it for and all it has to offer.",

Since it's the first time I've bought an unlocked model requiring a different SIM, insertion of the nano card was my only issue. Our carrier is T-Mobile and they were very helpful, but nobody thought to inform 'the uninitiated' about the tiny carrier tray. The card can easily jump the 1mm tray rim and get jammed, which it did. ALSO, if the punch-out leaves a plastic tag file it down. If this is complicated for you my advice is to take your new phone to your carrier to help with set-up.

The usual complain is you can't download Google/Android apps on it, but the fact is downloading just 4 files (browse Google for\"how to install play store on fire) you are ready to use play store on it. So it's a combination of Fire n Android. And personally I think the going back by swiping up is just sooo cool n way easier than pressing a designated back button common in every other phone.

I wasn't sure how to do that so my husband suggested we try out the Mayday feature. That is so cool! We connected with someone right away. He pretty much took control of my phone to lead me to the right app to download so I could use my Amazon music as ringtones. My previous phone, the AT and T Z998 was slow and had hardly any memory.

The only frustrating thing for me software wise is the ignored Google app store. Which is not hard to fix. (Google it ya lazy people.)

I would highly recommend this product, especially for the price that it keeps coming out with. Not sure I'd spend over $400 for any phone, let alone this one. But at $199 plus Amazon Prime it can't be beat. As others have said, the battery can drain, but I found that as long as I charge it nightly it lasts for me throughout the day without any problems.

The operating system lags a LOT, things reset themselves, not as many apps as the iphone or even Android (yes, this is an \"Android\" based phone, but all Android apps do not work with the fire phone), firefly is pretty useless, the voice command starts automatically when not wanted causing apps to stop.

I intended to load Google Play store to the phone. Initially, it was hard to find articles about rooting the phone and side loading Google Play store. After I got the phone, I found a way by following traces of XDA articles and published it at https://plus.google.com/117869787603044385058/posts/DSL9H4w9MsB; it was the more than 10 times easier than rooting and side loading apps on Kindle tablets. I did not have to root the phone to load the apk files. I gave it to a friend as a gift. If you plan to do so, remember to reset the device to unlink your Amazon account from the phone. The phone's hardware is super. Any phones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and 4G LTE compatible with T-mobile would cost you more than $400. I don't like the hardware design of leaving large area at the top and bottom of the phone similar to iPhone 6's front body design. The fire phone may not have a choice but to leave the space for accommodating the 5 cameras in the front. After side loaded Google Play store, I install more than 10 apps from the Play Store and all worked as expected. No dysfunction in terms of software and hardware. The 32 GB internal storage is superior than Moto G 2nd generation and iPhone 6 16 GB. Having the device at $200 makes iPhone 6 buyers idiots. You can buy 4 of Fire phones and get 4 years of prime membership for the price of a iPhone 6. That's why I wrote a 1 star review of iPhone 6 on Amazon. I claim I've used both devices, have return iPhone 6 at full price to Apple store, and the friend who received fire phone has been satisfied with it.",

I can go on and go on of how great this phone is. \"Why are you giving this 4 stars?\" you might ask. Well, the only problem with this phone with dynamic perspective from my perspective is that the device heats up really quick, but, being this is a Amazon's first generation phone, that's fine, but I'm giving it four stars. If we could give the phone a rate, I would give it a 9/10. I think Amazon did really good on their first generation phones!!

It provides unflawed reception with its 4g with Consumer Cellular I use because they have voice plans and data plans, individually packaged for use depending on one's need.  But contrary to Neilson saying that Consumer Cellular is the best rated cell co. in the U. S.  Their sale of phones, a Motorola flip phone, and in a 45 day window to switch phones I bought Huaweii smart phones, they 3 g, and the phones would continually read Emergency Calls Only when I would turn them on, not My Network, and with two ATT cell towers one only 3 miles away, and another maybe 6 miles away, I had almost all my attempts in calls saying this Emerg. Calls Only.  I would have to turn off particularly the Huaweii phones Consumer Cellular sold me, have one of the like model replaced with the same, all they will do, the consumer having bought their phones outright and despite continual problems with these now 3g phones, and there dropping calls regularly, and even in my own town it told me on the road that the local town call I was making, in this town was \"Out of Range.\"  They also mistakenly told me that the last phone I had could be sent back for repair, and it was sent back, my own expense to send it to them, and I got a letter from that that it was out of warranty, and they said the prongs for it to recharge were broken.  I used a magnifying glass to see if this was true and none were broken off.  Also the Huaweii phones I had a recharging wire that continually fell out, not because anything was broken, but because there was nothing to hold in the recharge wire.  I used duct tape, resting the phone with wire in all sorts of ways to keep it charging, it often not and falling out anyway.  I got all kinds of excuses from Consumer Cellular about these Huaweii phone, they blaming a very populated area along major routes in western NY as possibly making their service unusable for me.  Yet it was there customer sales that recommending these Huaweii smart phones over a Motorola smart phone I wanted to buy saying the Huaweii phones were superior.  Supervisors and even the presidents of this highly rated company refused to give me a $$ credit to find a phone that actually works with Consumer Celluar.  I have not give up on the Consumer Cell service, but I have given up on buying their phones, the ones the pushed that I buy seldom allowing to use my cell phone, and when they finally did say My Network, the would say Emerg. Calls Only in the middle of a call.  Who I would call back would not reach me, holding these pathetic phones they sold me, and their call back message went to voice mail immediately.  By  the time I was able to turn my phone off and wait forever for it to get back saying My Network, often who I had called before Consumer Cell had dropped my call were themselves busy with someone else, many minutes having passed, and sometimes it was their voice mail I got.  I began to use their phones less and less, they entirely unhelpful.  When I tookd delivery on this Amazon Fire Phone, this one working with ATT lines and Consumer Cellular, one of their customer personal having sent out the wrong SIMM card for it of theirs, the Amazon one taking the smallest one, the customer rep at Consumer Cellular said they thought the Amazon being 4g would indeed work for me.  I was also told by another Consumer Cell rep, the lower level ones the most helpful and honest that she thought the Huaweii smart phone I had, it was not the lowest level one, may have too short an antenna is it and they be why it with the Consumer Cell service was so poor.  The Amazon Fire Phone I purchased works great with the ATT lines here, and it hasn't ever in 2 months of use, dropped a call, or said that calls could not be made, never saying Emerg. Calls Only, and always saying My Network or its version of the term that says the phone is ready for use.  Kudos for making such a great phone, it having many good features and it acutally works 100% of the time.  I don't know how Nielson rates cell phone companies, but my experience hasn't been taken into consideration of the stellar rating they continue get.  With Consumer Cellular largely dealing with AARP customers, they 50 and older, and a group that may not use their Consumer Cell phone from them, or its service, may be getting bum service and not knowing, saving it with the least voice plan for an emergency call maybe even a child of their bought for them.  Therefore they may have rated this company high, not knowing that when the time comes to use it, it may not work.  But, Amazon appears to have made a very well throughout phone with a very good camera, it likely superior in quality to even Apple.  And Amazon Fire Phone has 24-hour support with Mayday.  I hope the good, the bad, and the ugly of cell phone service, even if it is at a reasonable price, can only work with whatever company recommending, selling, whatever a combination of service and phone that actually serves the customer well at all.  The Amazon Fire Phone with this Consumer Cell service fits the bill.  Long life Amazon.",

Came all hooked up with my account so I was able to get right to listening to music.the set up was really easy and pretty much took very little time getting used to it. As far as people saying fire os doesn't work for phone they are way wrong. I really am finding the is to be nice, it's very much set to let people do what they do.normally I'd have to spend a bunch of time arranging my home screen to get what I use most on it, but fire just shows mgs what I normally use and since you still have the option to rearrange things it makes it pretty easy to always get what I want.I am a fan of Windows phone and just got my wife a new one but I think fire will work well for me(just to be clear I also don't have problem with normal droid and have a few).but I wanted to give a first impressions review and later add sidenotes or changes. I like the keyboard as its really easy to type longer things and normally I would use my computer to type this but I can go pretty fast this way so it's not a hindrance the camera is nice and best shot is very helpful and holding the shutter button to take a series of photos is useful.have been having fun with dynamic perspective and can't wait to see future use of it and for a nice price of 229 I couldn't help myself. After spending a couple off weeks looking at phones couldn't find a reason too not get this. And on a different note about the is. I don't have a kindle fire so I didn't really know much about the fire is assisted from twice using other people's, and it is a really fluid is.

I actually have to use my thumb... but aside from starting apps while the phone is booting I've never had lag problems, still haven't had battery life issues, 4g works great when I'm in covered areas, Firefly has become  a greatly used tool for me. love that amazon cloud syncs my photos and videos so i can clear out my phone regularly and it's all saved, have one tiny little scratch on my screen now that is noticeable in reflected light but not when the screen is on which is good after 6 months without a screen protector, have dropped this phone on concrete several times and got alittle scratch on the side material but the screen and back glass are fine... have noticed that playing games a lot with it charging it warms up, but if im charging it i normally am at home and don't need phone games. The included mail app still works better than any gmail app I've had.. it works better than the website even. I still don't have any complaints.. it's a very nice phone and i don't expect to use anything else until amazon decides to make a new phone... and i hope they do, and i hope they use this phone as a base because I'd definitely buy a Fire Phone 2",

I am so grateful for the limited time sale that I was able to take advantage of. I probably never would have gotten a smart phone if it were not for that sale price.  I chose to load Wal-Mart Family Phone on mine. Had a little trouble finding a nano SIM card, but eventually tracked one down. Perfect signal strength, and just a little over thirty dollars a month, twenty less than my land line. I am able to make the peek function work, the tilting works great too.

I like the gestures and the swiping, much more than pressing buttons.  I have removed most items from the carousel that I don't need so now it's easy to get to where I want to go.  I tried the \"trick\" of uploading the required apps to allow access to Google Play Store and was successful. The problem is trying to trick the credit union into thinking that you have a stock android of any variety.  They see right through the disguise.  If I could get the apps I actually would use, however I would have to do it, I would be a happy camper.  I got Hangouts to work and could make calls without a SIM card, no problem.  That's great when you're home or on another WI-FI network but wouldn't be very helpful in the car.  I'll probably add another line to my cell phone plan and be good to go.  Actually, I hardly ever use my mobile credit union apps except when I need to make a mobile deposit.  I'm guessing my Harmony Smart Control Remote app might be a challenge as well.

The photo book is one folder.  Period.  You can not break your photos into folders or albums.  you can not block certain photos from being seen by others.  You know you have a few photos on your phone you don't want anyone to see when you are showing them photos of the kids.  But too bad.  They are either out there for all to see or not on your phone.  Period.  Let's talk about the apps.  More like what apps?  ATT is seriously not an app you can get for your fire phone.  And I have ATT service.  How is that even possible.  This phone is so bad, ATT does not want to put an app on it.  Neither does Bank of America, my credit union, Chase, etc.  So forget about actually using this phone.  Nothing works on it.  Your friends will say hay play this game, and you have to sit there sad faced because you can not.  I am probably going to sell this POS for a real phone.  A $20 phone I can get on Craigslist has more potential than this thing.  Shame on you Amazon for not allowing people to use the Google play store on a phone originated by the same software.",

For the most part this phone is pretty cool but is lacking a couple features I am either used to having or thought it had but doesn't.  First of all, the battery life is short if you actually use the phone like I do, which is the same as other phones I have.  If its sitting there in stand-by it will last but as soon as you start using it...  Another thing, that is so simple, is a message notification light.  Once you receive a text or other notification and the phone makes a noise to notify you that's it.  There is no little blinking light to indicate that you missed a call or you received a text/notification so you have to continuely check your phone if it is not on your person at all times.  I have had my phone for a couple weeks and have had to reboot it because it stopped notifying me period of of text/calls/emails.  I love the camera, the pictures are awesome but I have also had issues with a long lag time when I am deleting photos or have edited a photo, the whole phone locks up until it decides to finish what it is trying to do.  It is in no way because of lack of storage because I have plenty of that.  The Firefly feature is also very cool.  I do have a general complaint for Amazon on a whole and for your information.  If you ever have had a family member or you have worked for Amazon (even if you or they no longer work there) and get a survey about specific Amazon products (Kindles, FireStix, Fire Phone etc.) and you tell them that, you are not authorized to take the survey.  Well guess what, those people are not the ones that bought the product I did and if I have an opinion on it I want to express it regardless (my family members no longer work for them and haven't for a long time) of someone elses employment.  I purchased it, I'm using it, not them.  If Amazon read any of my previous (numerous) reviews they would see that I rate the products fairly and offer good information/suggestions based on MY opinion and not because someone I know works(ed) there and the information in MY survey could have been helpful to them because they will probably not read this review and will not know the issues, but bottom line is, you will know.",

I love the Firefly app as it is able to identify almost any movie or song I've thrown at it. If I was someone who was attached to my phone (instead of someone who doesn't have it when watching TV) it would be even more beneficial.

To me this method is fine but I was a Android user before and I do miss the back button sometimes. On the bad side it is a little glitchy sometimes but nothing too bad. And the dynamic perspective is pretty cool but it does drain battery. Since this is amazon it will have a shop app and other amazon related tools but it comes in handy to have it right on your phone especially with prime. Now the amazon app store is much better than I thought I found almost all the apps I used on android except youtube and other google related appsbut overall not bad.

A high-end smart phone at $199.99 is worth every penny, not to mention a year-long Prime subscription at no additional cost. I have iPhone 4S and iPad experience. I like them but do not want to spend over $700 to upgrade it to iPhone 6.  Fire Phone is about the same size as iPhone 6 though an ounce heavier. Its appearance and layout look good. I have no problem to navigate its functions. The font size of text message is small. But I can tape it three times to zoom in/out conveniently. The keyboard has plenty space between each character, especially when the phone is at horizontal position. This is great for fat fingers and older people who do not texting as frequent and skillful as young people. I am a pro-amateur photographer. Most of the time, I use my Nikon D7000 and a pack of specialized lens. It is amazing to find that my Fire Phone camera can produce good quality photos \u2013 an handy good camera in my pocket.",

I just got it, and only started using it today, but I love it so far!  Like any new gadget, it takes some getting used to.  But is seems to be pretty easy to navigate.  I have not even begun to delve in to all this phone can do, but I am certain I won't be disappointed.  I was already a Prime member, so having those features integrated in to the phone is a nice feature.  The phone itself is light weight.  I had a Samsung Galaxy 3 prior to this - the screen is smaller/thinner from side to side, but the lighter weight more than makes up for it.  I bought the leather case as well, which snapped right it to place without issue.  I have only intermediate experience, at best, with cell phones.  My grandkids usually have to help me figure things out.  But so far, I have been able to navigate the Fire Phone pretty much on my own.  I'm sure the younger set will love this phone (my son-in-law, who is in his mid 30's, already wants one), but it is working out pretty well for this 50-something user.",

I am always opening apps especially the camera and mayday just picking up the phone or laying it down. But the side menus are difficult to get to open when I want them and often end up with something else open trying to get them to appear. The touch seems inconsistant - sometimes barely touching will open something but other times I have to punch hard or swipe several times to get something to open. On the positive side the phone and messaging were easy to get to work and seem to work well. Setting up contacts was also easy although took a little time. And the phone works well as an e-reader, an advantage of a larger screen. The keypad works ok except for the small size of the numbers and letters. Learning how to download books and music took some time but works well once I figured it out.  I have only used the camera once and it seems to work ok. Probably will not be using that feature much anyway. The wi-fi works well - no problems getting set up or using.

The camera is awesome, the size is about perfect (not too bulky or wide, and not too tiny), High res display is pristine, and overall this seems like a very sturdy phone as well. The 2 GB of RAM powers any kind of game or app that your heart desires. Also, multitasking is so easy and fast on this phone; you can jump from tab to tab to app, to back to tab to app...with seamless ease. Probably the best feature, though, is the free 1-year membership to Amazon Prime! Before buying this phone, I did not even realize how many benefits come with being an Amazon Prime member. Not only do you get free 2 day shipping on most Amazon items, but you also get access to a library of stream-able movies, music, and much much more! If anything, buy the phone for this membership, because it pays off.",

This isn't really a problem for me as I have all the apps I already need. But for someone else, this might be an issue.

Also there are a few very nice features like the ability download prime video's offline and the Mayday help.  The integration with Amazon is also useful if you shop with them a lot.  Therefore I give it 4*, however as it stands the Amazon phone has no future because of it's lack of apps.  The most important feature of any phone these days are what apps it runs.  Many people complain that there are none of the Google Apps but that is just the thin end of the wedge.  There are so many apps missing from their store.  My banks app is not there; most airline apps are missing; the app for the NYC local ferry operator; the app for NYC buses; WeChat!!.  If you want to use an app you probably have a 50% hit rate.  It's never going to be good enough and developers are just not going to bother porting over their apps for such a tiny slice of the market.  If Microsoft can't succeed Amazon never will.",

Two weeks ago when the unlocked fire phones went on sale, I decided to buy one. I love it. I love the size of the screen, the numbers on the phone, the animated wall paper that changes daily. It is easy to use (an adjustement from apple, but not daunting).  I still have an ipad and my macbook pro which I use for my podcasts and other apple type features, and I don't see me ever not having a macbook and an ipad,but I am extremely happy with the fire phone. It works great, looks great, is simple enough to use.  Now that I have one, I am really a bit suprised that these have not made a bigger dent in the Apple market.

I still have a lot to learn but have been pleasantly surprised with how easy the transition has been so far. Many features included with this phone are unique to it, and based on several comments from friends, relatives, coworkers and even two total strangers, are very useful and desirable.

The biggest problem is the lack of support. It's not the most developed for phone out there. I was still able to install the Google Play App Store so I had access to almost any app on android (since the phone uses a modified version of android). That really helped the transition and for anyone who like me thinks the Amazon App store is lacking, then you can still install apps from \"3rd Party\" from Android.",

Amazon has added a lot of apps to their app store but there are still a number of apps that are not supported which is a bummer.  The Mayday representative I spoke with regarding these apps advised me that I can \"sideload\" apps but that may void my warranty.  I was able to sideload about 1/3 of the apps I had on my Galaxy (1/3 were available via the amazon app store), and the final third require google play services to run, which you can sideload but it is not supported and the google play services app will not work, so those apps are not available.  The year of prime is nice but I already had prime.  An interesting thing with the boasted firefly technology is that you cannot tap a phone number in a webpage and have it open in the phone which seems really odd to me since I could do that with the S3.  Ultimately, this phone was cheaper than fixing or replacing my S3 and will do for the few months before my current contract is up for renewal when I'll get another android phone.",

This is a nice piece of hardware with lots of bells and whistles. Amazon music that comes installed with the phone doesn't include prime music, had to install prime music app separately ( don't understand the logic behind it), not a big deal. Works with t-mobile LTE flawlessly. This is an excellent device considering the price. There are different options available to rid the carousel but installing a 3rd party launcher. I have heard the battery life issues but also read that battery life is better by turning off the dynamic 3D features which I don't care much about anyways. Grab it while you can.

I think the battery handles just as well as my galaxy did. I do wish that the background were customizable, and that there were widgets instead of just the carousel.

Second, when I called amazon fire phone text support, the person told me there was no such thing as WiFi calling and proceeded to tell me that I was lying even though I had been doing it for past 2 years with my other cell. Uninformed tech help isn't good. Finally, I was hoping to use this cell for my music instead of bringing my a second device but I only got a few hours of music before battery died.

The OS is similar the Kindle Fire HD so it was easy to get use too and a nice break away from the stock Android. Wife upgraded to this phone after many years of the galaxy S line up.  This phone is fast enough to get the job done and clear sound and picture quality. The camara is slow but takes good quality pictures.

The dynamic perspective is pretty visually stunning (my six year old loves to just watch the lock screen graphics), but it doesn't really have a function.

I haven't really checked out the App Store, so I'm not sure what kind of support it is getting in that category.  The only issue I'm even remotely concerned with is batter life.  The phone comes off the charger around 5AM and 12 hours later, without making any calls, it's down below 50%.  But, I can't really say it's the design of the phone, I live in an area where is switches between different signal strengths and data capabilities, and spends a lot of time Searching for the signal.  So, this may be the cause of the battery issue.  Overall, this phone is pretty nice for the price.",

Tested the Mayday once and used it once for a question I had. Works perfect!!! Let me say for anyone that's never owned or used a smartphone, the Mayday button will make the transition that much easier.  To be fair, anyone on Android that is heavily reliant on Google Services will have to side load the Google Play store. Amazon has most of the apps I've come to depend on excluding a few. I really hope Amazon follows up with another version because I'm really impressed with the Firephone.",

In the description it doesn't tell you that this takes a nano SIM card. It's an easy fix however I have metro pc's so they charge $35 fire a new SIM card and $15 to change phones. That's the price you pay for a non contact phone! But would rather pay $40 a month for unlimited than have a contracted phone with horrible service! This phone picks up service very well. I work in a concrete building and had service only by the window on the store. Nite I have service just about everywhere and van even pick up the Wi-Fi across the street!",

The phone already started off at an amazing deal, then I found out we get a free year extension added on to our Amazon Prime membership! We were going to renew it anyways, so that makes the phones price come down to only $100! Aside from the price the phone itself has things that NO other phone on the market has, as well as factory unlocked and a solid 32gb... Best deal ever hands down!",

The battery life is very good too.  Because Amazon has had Fire tablets and the Amazon software market for quite some time, there are a lot of apps available for this phone.  You can even load apps onto this phone from other sources on the internet.  But even with that extra supply, there are still too many apps missing.  I would like the Target app, and others.  You can usually use the web site for any missing apps.  But the Amazon Silk Internet Browser always crashed for me.  It wasn't much of a problem because I replaced it with Firefox, but I am surprised that  the Silk Browser crashed every time I used it.  Another issue is that the unlock screen and the home screen are slow.  They often take 1 or 2 seconds to load.  I know that shouldn't matter, but the competition doesn't have this problem.  The notifications on the home screen were odd.  Certain notifications - like a temperature app reload themselves every so often, and so the screen would come on and show the most recent notification - which would be the weather.  But that notification would replace a more important notification such as an incoming text message.  Why should it be limited to the 1 most recent notification?  And if it has to be that way, they should make certain recurring notfications not replace the 1-time notifications.  Also the phone application (this is a phone) wouldn't always place calls, and I couldn't receive MMS messages unless I turned my wi-fi off.  I did replace this phone with an iPhone.  If the phone and texting weren't buggy I may have kept this as my primary phone.  I am glad that Amazon has a separate marketplace than the Google Play marketplace.",

Sometimes when I swipe, nothing happens for a few seconds.  The wrist-flicks to show the side menus work maybe 25% of the time.  Sometimes when I click on a link embedded in an email, it opens the browser and then nothing happens.  No page loads.  This is a small example of my dissatisfaction with this phone, and maybe others have had better luck, but if not for the price I would seriously regret buying it.  As it stands,  I have been a Prime member for some time so it was basically a $100 phone, and that's hard to argue with.  I just wish it were a little more dependable.",

The fire phone was on sale for $150 less than a new iPhone. $150 is a big chunk of change. My husband ordered the Fire phone for Valentine's day. I'm so glad he did! I love it. You, have to remember it's not an iPhone. It does all the things my iPhone did just in a different way. The short on screen tutorial that pops up during the setup is very helpful. So far, I have not found anything  that my Fire phone can't do. I have never had an unlocked phone before. Setup was easy, I pressed the Mayday button and the tech advisor walked me through the process. Speaking of the Mayday button, it's the best thing ever!If I want to know how to do something, I don't have to waist time digging in the manual or watching videos. I just press the button and a live person talks to me. It's great! I can ask my little questions like how do I add a picture to my address or I can't find the video I just took. With Maydays help I am finally using my all of my phones abilities. Also, I love the free year of prime. It's not just the 2 day shipping that gets me  but the movies and music. I saw reports about poor battery life. It's hard to tell. I am using my Fire phone more than I did my iPhone. Now,that I have streaming music and can watch movies while sitting in carpool line. I do have to charge the battery during the day. But it is quick to charge. I am very pleased and would buy it again.",

But Amazon killed themselves with this phone by not allowing the google playstore and basic custimization of the phone. I find the carousel to be a pain and I do not use it. I have played around with different launchers, but have not settled on one that meets all of my wants. Even basic things like setting the wallpaper is disabled.

The built in apps for those functions appear to have been after thoughts for the creators of this phone.  It's been difficult to find apps that I like that will fully integrate with this phone.  Since that's what I mostly use a phone for, I'm debating about returning this one.  If you are set in your ways like me, you should probably pass on this phone as it takes a lot to adjust to it's basic functionality.

It doesn't get some of my favorite aps which I could live with but there are other things I found to be a problem with this. The auto scroll feature I ended up turning off because it scrolls when you move your head and I found it scrolling all the way to the bottom of the page if I'd move my head wrong! When I am on the internet, I randomly have to click above or below what I am trying to select because clicking right on it selects something different but it isn't the same each time. This means tons of time spent trying to navigate to the correct page. When using the map/navigation feature, it constantly had me in the wrong location and would try to make me U-turn to get back to where I actually was. I've not had that problem on my previous phones using the same service. I liked the price and needed to renew prime anyway but I'm about to go back to my dreaded iPhone. I'll keep looking for a phone I can love. The good, the battery seems to last a long time when settings are right. The call volume and clarity was excellent but I'm a texter more than a talker. The games in the app store that are designed for this phone were pretty spectacular. I will keep this as a backup if my iPhone breaks or gets lost but it will never be up to par to be my daily phone.",

I end up having to remove items from the carousel after each use.  Maybe it can be turned off but I haven't seen how yet.  Using the included mail app I have not been able to figure out how to see any folder other than the in box folder.  I can't figure out how to delete recent calls from the call log or history in the phone app.  These things are easy to figure out on other phones.  I suppose I could use the Mayday feature but don't think that should be necessary for such usually simple tasks.  If they would improve the user interface I would give it 5 stars.  Like Windows 8 and 8.1 it is more complicated than it needs to be.  I would only buy another if the operating system is cleaned up and simplified.  People want nice apps.  They don't want to think too much just to navigate the phone.  I hope Amazon reads this review and takes it to heart.  Simplify the OS and you will sell more phones.",

Well, once my iphone started to die out, I decided to buy something cheap but reliable.  Well, the amazon phone definitely is cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for.  This is the second day I've owned it and already it just died out on me while it was charging with 60% battery life.  It took me a few minutes before the thing would finally turn back on. I mean REALLY?!  I love Amazon but their phone is just total rubbish.  It's not really intuitive and some of the functions like flicking of the wrist to open up a certain menu rarely works unless your shaking it like your having a spasm.  Battery life also stinks as it went from 92% to 61% in about an hour of playing around with the phone and browsing the app store.",

As everyone knows, the Amazon App store is greatly dwarfed by the massive Google Play Store, so this automatically detours new customers. With this being said, Amazon needs to market for better apps to meet customer demands (like better texting and keyboard apps). As for the device itself, I'm a stock holder for Amazon, so I took a chance and switched over from my Droid. Luckily, I have a Fire HDX, so I had a rough idea on how to navigate the Fire OS. My wife on the other hand is pulling her hair out trying to figure it out. One key thing that the Fire Phone lacks is an actual back button. Currently you have to swipe upwards, which is frustrating because whenever I'm scrolling down a web page or Facebook, I always swipe too much and lose my page. I'm not saying Amazon needs to copy Android or Apple (to stay unique to their own OS), but it wouldn't hurt to take a look at what their customers enjoy so they can better improve themselves to possibly draw in more customers. I will gladly re-review and adjust my rating once I see Amazon making some changes.",

I wish the battery was a little better; but it is about three times the longevity of my Razr. At this time the phone is pretty much not Google friendly. I understand that there are ways to make it Google friendly; but I haven't figured them out yet. There are a lot of apps out for this phone; but, most of my most used apps are not available yet. Some folks have said Youtube was not available, it is. Facebook works really well on Fire phone. From my point of view it is a great phone- the main problem is that the app selection needs to catch up. If I could find it at $189 again I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.

I have been using apple but the new apple phones are too expensive and losing durability. The droid is married to google which takes over your identity. And than there is the hybrid fire which has a creative spot in this competitive market. Sure, some apps are missing but I believe they will come....give amazon a break, they have not been in the phone business a year yet. But, I have found every app I need to fine tune this fire phone into a leading edge fast tool. Differentiated products always take a little longer to get use to and the fire phone is no different. The rewards are there for the users that stick with it. Though, I am not sure if Amazon understands the capability of this phone and how it should be marketed.......now that I understand this fire phone I could put together a great marketing plan if I had the chance.",

Every other smart phone I have seen or owned (there have been quite a few) shows the battery life and signal strenghth at the top as soon as you unlock it. To see either of these with this phone you have to drag the top menu down. Also, you only get a low battery warning when you are under 10%. To make matters worse, the phone (mine at least) will not charge from a computer USB port if the phone is on, so I have to shut my phone off to charge it. Most issues except the charging could probably be fixed with a software update. Hopefully others have voiced these concerns and a change may be coming someday.",

More than internet & email access, I wanted a good music player and a great camera. I had to spend an additional $24.99 to buy Prime Music for a year so I could actually get my music on my phone from iTunes because they would not sync as promised and the camera is simply terrible -- it may be 13 megapixles, but the lens must be garbage because it takes terrible photos (yes, I know how to take pictures because I was a photo major in college & no, that does not make me a camera snob, I like any good camera).

I use StraightTalk & I had no problem setting it up. I did have to purchase a nano card from StraightTalk but it was cheap and easy to install.

I haven't looked into if the phone is capable of WiFi calling yet, if it does, that would be a Huge plus as well.

Sound quality is good, battery life is good, and it's a huge benefit that the phone is GSM and is not locked to a specific carrier.  I love my Fire Phone; thank you Amazon.",

I won't change it for anything i could download Google core apps and the Play Store and everything was perfect. I don't give the 5 stars because i broke the screen of the phone and Amazon couldn't send me replacement. I contacted them and they told me i should get the screen from a third-party seller and i did it and it was way too expensive. So keeping that aside, it's a great phone and just for $200 !",

There is no visual voicemail either. If the phone was open to Google Play I would probably give it 4. If it also had the software to allow wifi calling I would give it 5 stars. Otherwise it is a great device. All its limits are imposed by Amazon not by technology or innovation.

Is shows recent history for apps that you use. So, for example, if you have private messages between you and your wife, be careful hitting the home button in front of someone because it displays your recent messages to anyone looking. Or your recent browsing history or recent pictures you took or emails and so on. This carousel thing might be ok if it didnt show all recent activity and if you could arrange the order of the apps it displays. Instead it just automatically puts in the recent apps you used and its constantly repositioning them. Another issue is trying to show someone your phone. Its a nightmare. When two people are looking at the screen, I guess the phone gets confused and isnt sure which person to use for the dynamic perspective rendering. Every time I turn my phone to show someone something it scrolls way off of what I am trying to show. Very frustrating. The native silk web browser is just terrible and has lots of issues with many mobile-optimized sites. I find many features just dont work like trying to stream mp3 files from dropbox or just downloading the files. The camera seems to freeze quite often when im playing back recorded video. The limitation of \"Amazon only stuff\" is kind of annoying. There are ways to get googles android market and other apps on the device but its a pain having to do work arounds all the time and downloading apk files and dumping them on the device. The music player on the phone also has issues with freezing. It sometimes just sits there thinking when all im trying to do is play songs that are saved on the phone. Im not trying to stream them, just play from the devices storage. As a Samsung Galaxy user in the past, I guess im just not impressed enough to continue using this product. The dynamic perspective thing is pretty cool. Thats about the only thing I like about this phone.",

The phone arrived quickly and I was definitely impressed by the looks of the phone, kind of sleek but feels sturdy at hand. My excitement fizzled once I realized how crippled the FireOS compared to vanilla Android. What works great in a Kindle tablet, just does nto work in a phone. A phone is meant for one hand use and the carousal type app access was just not suitable for that. FireOS on Firephone lacks some of the most simple feature that I was spoiled with since 4 years of Android use. The notification area is severely lacking. Another huge minus point is lack of a back button. While the swipe action from the bottom of the screen work, it works haphazardly.

Great call quality, front and rear facing cameras and all the bells and whistles. Does his compete with other phones at its original price point - no it does not, (my other phone is a samsung note which runs circles around this in terms of feature set).  There's no built in stylus.  No bio-metric lock screen, which is hard to understand with five cameras on the front. The carousel menu is just awful, because even when you swipe open the app draw  there is no way to alphabetize the apps, so you're condemned to searching a random carousel or a random app draw. Sure you can pin stuff to the front, but that turns into a fiendish puzzle of trying to rearrange items into a logical order.  The carousel also precludes widgets. Finally and most importantly the app store for the Fire phone appears to be entirely un-curated. Many apps that run on other android phones and amazon products and are in the amazon app store are marked non compatible.  On the plus side when I have written amazon tech support about missing apps they have appeared quickly - but the question remains why are they missing in the first place.  This phone is bursting with potential - firefly is amazing, for a while you just walk around zapping stuff to see if its recognized, but that also is kind of techno gimmick and doesn't speak to day to day use as a phone. Also its all too obvious no-one field tested this product before it went to market; come on amazon you advertised it as NFC tag compatible and the app was marked non compatible - and only one app at that, not even Tasker -  and even now one third of that app is still missing in action!",

I have to keep trying until I can turn it off or on.  When I text, sometimes I have to hit the send button 2 or 3 times to send a message.  Another feature that is great when it works, is when I can shake the phone and my menu for airplane mode, wi-fi, flashlight, blue tooth, help, etc pops up.  Unfortunately, it doesn't always work like it is supposed to work.  Personally, I don't really have any use for what they call the carousel because you have to spend too much time scrolling to find your app whereas they are all listed on your home screen.  I did use the mayday help once and it is neat that they are available 24/7.  You can have help right away instead of waiting on a phone 20 minutes to speak to someone.  However, the assistant didn't solve my problem.  I had to Google my issue and fix it myself. They say you can see them but they can't see you.  Naturally, I have to wonder if that is really true.  Transferring the files from my old phone to my new fire phone were easy, but although it said it transferred my messages I have not found them as of yet.  They might be stored in a location I am currently unaware of.  It really isn't a big deal.  Another thing that really drives me nuts is when I type in a phone number the contact name does not pop up like it did in my previous phones.  They do have a VIP list where you can click on your contact, side swipe from the right, and select your contact or you can look at your history.  To me it would still be easier to start typing the number.  The contact name will pop up when you text message.  I have trouble with the music app that comes with the phone.  Sometimes I can't play any of my music unless I restart my phone.  I just get a message saying it can't play audio playback or something like that.  I have downloaded another music app.  I will see how it works out.  Of course the battery life lasts until about 3:00 pm for me.  I think if I put a picture in the background instead of using one of the cool screen locks that will help.  I did buy a portable charger to help charge my phone in my locker.  Again, would not be a big deal if the button to turn off the data worked properly.",

No matter how much you can tweak it, it still sucks, will always suck. FireOS lacks frequent updates, is bogged down, limited, built on top of old software, and built with a unique interface (but, not the good kind of unique). For instance, the habit I built from swiping up the screen to go back has affected my interaction with all my other non-fire os devices.. ipad, regular android phones, windows tablet, etc. And having the MAYDAY button always visible in the notification tab is almost insulting to a power user.",

On that one, I was told to go in settings and refresh the app that wasn't responding.  Really? I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get the phone to work properly. Called MayDay for assistance and the end result was almost always the same, \"they are working on fixing that\".  Really? I kept trying to like it for 3 months but got so aggravated, I turned my iphone back on!  I only wish I came to this conclusion a lot sooner so that I could have returned it. So now, lesson learned and I just paid top dollar for Prime membership for a year and have a phone that I will not use.  So all you iphone users that want to try something different, don't.

One reason being that the phone does not work with Google Play which is where many Android apps are purchased and second, the OS is not at the level that other Android phones of the same time frame are at.  In addition to that, there is a steep learning curve on using this phone as it is not remotely configured to be as intuitive to use as all of the other phones I have owned were.  I also cannot get the ring tone volume that I need to hear the phone if it is not on my person.  Buttons are located in inconvenient places and do not always do what they are supposed to do.

Amazon should really leave Android the way it is and not messed with it.  Also get rid of the Amazon store.  The phone is too thick and heavy.

I sometimes don't get texts or calls and then a bunch will come in at once, even though I never lost service. The internet just doesn't load sometimes.

Every app I added to the Fire phone that I also had on my Windows phone worked better on the windows phone. I think the hardware in this phone is fantastic. But the software kills the deal. Dynamic perspective is a useless gimic, it gets old in about 15 seconds. Also, Amazon customer service told me there would be no issues with running two Fire phones on the same Prime account. But as soon as I uploaded my contacts and Prime music to my phone, my wife's contacts and music got all messed up on her Fire phone. Some were relabeled, overwritten, or just disappeared. This is not an issue someone with just one Fire phone would encounter, but after being told specifically that it wouldn't happen this significantly added to my disappointment.

Don't be too excited yet, because while this is an amazing feature the camera leaves a lot to be desired when recording videos. I was really mislead by the description of the camera that Amazon posted. There is a setting, which you can not adjust, that causes the videos to be VERY grainy and their \"reason\" for doing this is to save on data usage. Why can I not decide that for myself? I also can not get a lot of the news apps or blackboard, which if you are a college student/ teacher maybe a issue. Often I have apps just close out randomly. One of the selling points with this phone is the one free book or song, but I have no idea how to actually get those or where to look on my phone to find out, because there is only the fire start app to explain things and no actual paper manual. If I had not already committed to this phone I would definitely get a different one. I am sincerely hoping there will be some revision done so my phone operates better soon.",

I think Amazon assumed that since they sold truck loads of Kindle Fire devices the owners must love the OS. I don't agree. Folks like me bought the Kindle's because we liked the idea of the Kindle as a reader and a tablet for simple web surfing.  In other words we tolerated the OS because we like the device itself. A phone is completely different. We use these all day and night and generally have them with us at all times so the OS becomes the key attraction almost more than the device. Some love iOS and some love Android. As an example, I've been with Android since the beginning but I can't tell you how many different phones I've had during that time - it was the OS I stuck with, not the phone. Bottom line, if Amazon had used the latest Android OS (with Google Play) and then added their Amazon \"flavor\" to the phone via home screens, sub-menus, etc., they would not be dumping these phones for $99 (factoring in the cost for Prime).",

I do find the phone a little delicate, dropped it once, and it survived.  I did get a case which makes it easier to handle and a screen protector cause the fingerprints were very annoying.  The battery lasts a lot longer than my old slider phone and the voice quality is much better as well.  My husband got the phone when it was 199, I would never have paid 400 for it.  I have read the good and bad reviews, since I was not a dedicated google user, I find the fire phone fun and performs great for what I need.  I do reserve the right to add an addendum in the future.",

Amazon has pretty much been awesome for me. I thought the Fire phone would be a great addition to my Amazon family, not to mention the free year of Prime I would get. So, of course I jumped in at the beginning, July 29, 2014, and chose the AT&T Next installment plan to pay for it. I was super excited to have it! One of the hugest selling points for me was the storage - free cloud storage for your photos! I take a TON of photos, and was constantly running out of space on my iPhone. So, imagine my surprise when I discover last night (6/28/15 - almost a year to the day) that the free photo storage is a bit of a fib. Last night, this is the message I received: \"Your storage is critically low. YOUR WIFI AND USB TRANSFER HAS BEEN TURNED OFF UNTIL YOU DELETE ITEMS TO CREATE MORE STORAGE.\" Let me ask a simple question: How the heck am I supposed to \"create more room\" if my wifi and USB transfer has been disabled? I attempted to delete some photos and it told me they would be PERMANENTLY DELETED - from my phone AND cloud. I had to delete apps that I had not used in a while to get my wifi and USB transfer back. This is bull****. SERIOUSLY MISLEADING. It turns out that while photo storage is unlimited, you can only have 5MB of video, and then it's $59.99 for more. Play sad horn here (wah wah waaaahhh). So, since I have had this piece of crap for a year, I feel I can clearly state what the issues have been for me and this dumb, dumb phone that I can't wait to get rid of.",

I am not a tech junkie, but neither am I technically challenged, and I have tried the sideload crap at least five times, following people's \"helpful\" links and googling instructions and etc etc, and I HAVE NOT been able to figure it out. Perhaps that makes me stupid. Then I read a review on here from June of 2014 in which the reviewer said he had sideloaded Google play and it eventually began giving him a ton of error messages. SO. Appears that sideloading doesn't work after all. I actually have a note created that is titled, \"Apps I cannot have\" so when I finish paying for this junk and get an iPhone again I can remember what it was I wanted.

I will spend literal minutes trying to flick it to the screen that has the flashlight on it, and then minutes more trying to get the screen back to turn off the flashlight, YET this screen will come up with the slightest, most random movement, at the most inopportune time. Usually it's when I'm on a phone call and I'm trying to use the phone like a phone - you know, with it to your ear - and the flick screen will come up and my cheek will touch the airplane and BANG! I've ended my phone call by putting the thing in airplane mode. Oh, and don't forget the fact that not only will this fantastic screen respond to your fingers, it will respond to ANYTHING metal!

First, amazon you got prime music and video, couldn't you work your AOS (#amazon operating system) and hardware around that? Your screen sucks and so is the native audio output (speakers and buds). I don't know if this is a software issue but it sounds like your trying to play full highs, mids and lows through tweeters. Video playback was on par with my cracked iphone 5c but there are moments when the pages wouldn't load cause of the video was playing, the 720 screen has a hard time keeping up with the processor during portrait and landscape transitions. The \"dynamic\" camera feature, a lot of critics say it's a gimmick, true or false, it does what it claims to do, how this thing is utilized is completely benign to me, it's great technology but it's limited and subdued, Idk. Your looking at the best facial recognition hardware on a personal handheld device. I'm saying maybe you could rig it to unlock your phone? Maybe with some add-ons it could do augmented reality as unlock feature too. From what I've read online, this AOS is built on an android platform, I think you should run with it, but not in the direction of open source, I'm sure there is a huge market our there of android users who want the stability of an Apple device but at an affordable price. Strip it too the core, get your own team of app engineers. Your Appstore need a new name as well as your native apps to artfully tie them together, can't you call your Appstore \"the canopy\" or something related to \"amazon\", too gimmicky? Really?",

Althoug the maps app still does not work, I could finally solve it by installing Waze, which works perfectly in my country. In adition  I want to thank the Amazon's customer service staff  that contacted me to try to fix the problem.",

On top of the time issue, any speaker I connect works for voice calls but disconnects its self when I play a music app. This isn't a problem with the speakers connecting to my iPhone. My LG headset connects and plays music fine. The fire phone seems to take longer to connect and find WiFi also. I have tried numerous times with mayday and the most extensive instruction I have gotten so far is to turn it off and back on. It also won't connect to mayday while on WiFi only on cell service. After trying several times and being disconnected I got a notice I had tried mayday too many times I had to call in for further support. Overall it feels like  a small kindle that has internet.

It lists all numerous apps on the phone (seemed like all of them to me), each of which has to be manually removed by pressing on the icon and choosing remove. All 300+ books from my kindle library appeared in the carousel, each of which had to be manually removed. I checked with support there is no way to turn the books off by default in the kindle app. The tech support guy said that it only displayed a \"selection\" of my books but it seemed like all to me and am concerned that it will be updating that selection. A long long list is as useless as no list at all and spending lots of time managing that list isn't the reason I bought the phone. All in all really poorly designed software. I am seriously considering returning the phone. I gave it two stars because it was cheap, 189.00 unlocked. Other drawbacks - no micro sd slot, not much storage, no google play - but I knew these before purchasing.",

Once i opened the package and took out the phone, I didn't like the feel of it. It has Gorilla glass on front and back and feels heavy and cheap.  Then I realized that the phone has a sealed in battery, so no changing batteries.  Some reason I also overlooked the fact that it doesn't have a slot for an SD card so stuck with the 32G.  Even with all these annoyances I thought for the money I could live with it, until I tried to get some of my favorite aps which are not available for this phone...The only thing I really liked about this phone to be honest is that I could use immersion reading with my Kindle and Audible books and that there are two speakers on the phone.

I took advantage of the low pricing during at the beginning of December of $229.00 USD including a year of Prime. I was excited since we, as a family, own 3 Kindles and are very happy with them. I expected the phone to at least be a decent piece of equipment as any recent Kindle tablet but it's not the case. The hardware is inadequate and the software, including today's update is terrible. I used to ease my frustration by using Google Play but until a few weeks the recent updated made it impossible to download from anything except from the very limited apps from the Amazon App store. I strongly suggest waiting for a newer version and evaluate carefully instead of buying this phone. It is not worth it even at the current sale price of $189.00 USD with a one year of Prime included. You have other very good options in the price range of the terrible manufactured Fire Phone.",

But NOT at this price. I can get the 5C  64GB unlocked for under $250. :( I was willing to settle for less with the Fire for the price.....but that was then. Even Pre-ordered the ECHO just for fun. :P DISAPPOINTED. I would probably LOVE the phone....NOT at this price. Amazon should be offering better deals for better customers. :(",

First let me point that it is a good try, well as enteprenour you are, l guess that before inserting a product in to the market, l guess that you first take some important facts in consideration, first one is the  general public, the type of public to market a product base on their age, sex, and interest, second one it is what's on the market and what is selling actually, 3rd  how compatible is what you are selling, l wonder that with the big team of professional advisers and all those money that you invest in research to put a product in the market, how is posible that you have not been advised that a product have to be easy handler and flexible, well first let me make it more clear...we have a population basicly young people that are craze about installing, changing, and making stuff, and of course that population want to have some flexibility adding basics things like wallpaper with no headace or making miracle in order to do some change in their phone, well this is the case of apple and windows, each one of them has its own operative system, and despite that apple has created a sofisticated system the limitation they have keep them away from the population, windows in another hand has been flexible, and that's why it does not matter what they say about apple, windows is and is always gonna be the most popular operative system, you see! but let put another fact, if you limitated the buyer to use what you want and what you offer, then why don't you limitate  those virus that comes in those junk games that you offers in those applications?, well l guess that on the net that is difficult to control..the  fact is that young people can live with those junks games and application always that these young people  can make some change on their own, like easy change wall wallpaper even install another desktop or luncher if they wish, that is what make maybe android phone so popular now a day, they have their own version how ever it is open to third party with facilities. Ok you want to stablish with your own desktop and have these kind of this is mine nobody touch it, it is like,  use what you receive and if you want to do something else well, it is not possible, then let me tell you that is not possible, because people want diversity, people want to create, people want to mix up things, people want to combine things, people want flexibities, people want to add things, people want to take away things with no limitation, your phone is not bad, how ever the limitation that it has it makes this phone too far from starting an innovative product in the market, but you still have time to make some change and think about to give the people what they want if you as a producer don't take in consideration, first what people want, second flexibility for those young people, third be more open creativity, the who in the hell are you producing for? l HAVE GAVE YOU ONE STAR FOR YOUR INICIATIVE TO MAKE SOMETHING REAL GOOD TO BE INSERTED IN THE MARKET, ANOTHER START FOR YOUR WELL DESINED LOUNCHER DESPITE THAT STILL NEED SOME MORE ADJUSTMENT, AND NAOTHER STAR FOR YOUR WELL FUTURES IN THE PHONE LIKE CAMERA, AUDIO, ETC, how ever the two most important stars, are still to come and depend in what you do to make these phone more open to this new century, and you should think as business people l guess you are, that your new product is an inyection in a existent market which mean  that is not the consumers whom have to make an adjustment but you are, if you want to survive, anybody could try your product, how ever once one of those consumers tried your product a saw that is not up to the competence, first because it didn't have any flexibilities with third parties applications, what d you think it would happen?  IT WOUD BE DISCARD IT, then after that it come the bad reference, at the end...the worst...Finally but not the least..IF AMAZON anounce that is going to sell an unlocked  phone, the word unlocked has different meanings but in the term of market it has an universal meaning, it is no just that it can be use for different carrier, but also that is going to be open so consumer  experience and compare how functional this divise is in term of  applications use..if this new phone is not up to support another applications simply is not funtional to the mayority also the zise is a very important fact to take in consideration...",

I just don't understand why these companies cant stop being SOOOO greedy. Price wise, with the outdated specs, its TOO expensive. On contract the phone should be free, and unlocked the phone should $99. These things are made in China for cheap. If you have an ecosystem like Apple iTunes and Amazon, your focus should be to get a device in a customers hands and enjoy the money from music, videos, books, and magazines, not the initial thieving from over priced devices. The iPhone 6 is a whopping $649, for an unlocked one, you can buy a laptop for $199 these days. Even on contract the iPhone is over priced, too wide, and too long. You guys need to get your heads out of your bank accounts, and get smart about what users really want, then the money will flow beautifully.

I understand that you only built this phone as a vehicle for your (HORRIBLE) app store, etc, but if you just focused on making a good phone for a good price that people would actually want to buy, well, then people would buy it. By tying this great piece of hardware to an app store that is full of ad-ware and malware, you've doomed yourselves. Unlock the boot loader, or find a way to 'leak' your codes to XDA and you won't have to keep slashing the price.

The last tech spoke to me told me will get a phone out to you \" if you want \"3 to 4 month .

And whats with the comment \"if you want \" trying to discourage me and say forget it , I gave up, live with the blinking and the other problems like crackling on the speaker..At least I didn't buy it at the over 400. dollar price . I got one year of prime , 99.00 is hard to lose especially on disability , Im a teacher broke my leg with complications, so money is tight. By the way, if you have problem you will go thru steps from each person you talk to. Do you have another phone sir , ok they call on the other phone . Please shut phone off for 40 seconds and restart . Like I didnt do this before. Then if that doesn't work reset the whole phone . start from the beginning when you just got the phone , Do this a couple of times and youll be writing on here.",

When I take a photo or try to access my photos, it's not uncommon to see a black screen for a LONG time while it seems to \"think\". That's annoying and usually I just give up and ask someone else to take the photo using their phone. (2) The apps\u2026 what apps? Amazon will boast of the many apps designed for the fire phone but these are second rate apps filled with ads and 9/10 apps that I've wanted to download for use don't even exist (in any form) in their app store. It's depressing. Smart phones are useless without apps. Some notable missing apps: snapchat, google hangouts, mapmyrun, Jet Blue app, urban spoon, living social. The lack of Google Hangouts and Living Social especially make me think Amazon purposely (and strategically) excluded anything that could be considered competition for Amazon's competitive positioning. Another frustration (just because) is that the phone comes with an Amazon shopping app, Kindle app, Audible app, and silly games pre-downloaded to the device. These apps CANNOT be deleted by users/phone owners. C'mon, Amazon. I thought you were the \"most customer centric company in the world\". I'm calling your bluff.

I don't quite understand why FireOS and Google apps are mutually exclusive since this is built on top of android, but aside from side-loading some Google apps, you can't get them on your Fire phone.  If you have no allegiance to Google, android, or the Google Play Store, this could be a great phone for you since it is great hardware with some notable exceptions like no Bluetooth LE.  However, if you want something you can customize, look elsewhere; as an example, my 13-year-old wanted to install an emoticon keyboard and while we figured a way to install, it could not be enabled and as small a thing as that is, it was a showstopper for her.  Also, I could find very little information about setting these up for family; should I have had separate accounts or would anyone using the fire phone as their own have to piggyback off of my account thus my cloud becomes their cloud.  It would seemun fair to make my 13-year-old buy her own prime to have her own cloud.  So even though the price at the \"fire sale\" was exceptional, it might have to go back as she desperately wanted to switch back to her Moto G 2013, I wouldn't replace my Nexus 5, my wife needs Bluetooth LE, another daughter is happy with her Windows phone, and the last daughter prefers an iPhone with a shattered screen over this.",

But that's a pretty major app. When major ones like that are left out, there's little hope that your local bank will retool its app to work with Amazon or even put it in the app store. And it's not as if a third party is going to write an app to access your local bank. And if they did, would you trust it?",

Rather it is a rating of the other thing that is supposedly being sold along with the phone, that is, a year of Amazon Prime.  I feel that the system for adding time to my Prime by ordering a Fire phone was anything but transparent and automatic.  A few days after ordering, I looked online to see if my Prime account had been updated, but it had not, although my credit card had been charged and my gift cards removed.  So after a long search and many links followed, I finally talked to an Amazon rep.  There I found out that the phone must be activated by Amazon before the Prime subscription is added.",

I feel quite sure that Amazon's tech people would find this to be at least as easy as waiting for the phone to be activated.  In fact, part of the reason I purchased this phone was because the person I am giving it to travels internationally. What if he decided to use it in another country first, rather than activating it with Amazon? This hurdle means that I am not really getting Prime paid for for a year by buying this phone. It means that actually I am getting Prime in exchange for allowing Amazon to dump more advertizing on my unsuspecting recipient.",

Well unfortunately that isn't the case and I have had problems since day one. First the charger that was sent to me was carp and wouldn't work so I just used my ps4 charge cord and kept on because I love amazon and didn't want to return it for something I thought I could easily solve. WRONG, the phone is just bad and doesn't want to charge at all. If it does it charges/uncharges (noise/chimes and vibrates) every second because this terrible phone is just that. Next is the power saver on this (or should I say non existent power saver) literally I have to have the brightness all the way down just to make it thru the day without needing a charge but I can see anything so I leave it on auto so I can actually see the screen. Next the app management is God awful and for an Amazon product that is just insane but nevertheless it is and it's bad. Love how you have an app owned by Amazon (twitch) and it's worse than the app I got off google store. Had to add google store from because of Amazon store being so bad I wanted to slam the phone down, which also brings up another point I hate. WHY DO I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD GOOGLE PLAY IN THE FIRST PLACE?? Let alone I have to YouTube it just so I can get it on this hunk of junk phone.

In case you are not aware, you don't get access to any of the Google suite apps like Maps, Gmail, etc. The dinamic perspective is more of a gimic than anything else. Yes, it does look cool, but it doesn't really offers any special functionality. The best thing about this phone is that comes with 1yr of Amazon Prime, which cost $99 on its own. So technically you are paying only about $100 for it. If you look at it in that way, it might be worth it if this is going to be your first smartphone.....but not really.

However, I don't think you should need to watch the intro video to learn basic functionality, it should be intuitive, like any good phone or device. My main peeve is there is no back button. I'm a long time Fire tablet user and the controls you're used to aren't on this phone. Also, reaching your available apps, like in the Fire tablet (Cloud/Device), is nearly impossible and is achieved by swiping up from the bottom or the left-hand corner when the settings icon (gear) is centered above; it always take a few tries. You have to tap more than once frequently for general navigation. Navigation and layout is the most confounding thing I've ever seen on a device, and again I'm a regular Fire tablet user. Also, the \"home screen\", which basically doesn't exist, is... simply ugly. No one wants to look a gear. Random app icons is almost as bad. There is no graphic. The lock-screen is cool and animated, it responds to movement of the phone. There are some neat features, like tilting the phone for left and right-hand side-menus and reverse to remove them. Some of your regular Cloud apps (if you use Fire tablets) will be available *if* you can locate the menu; clicking anywhere on \"Apps\" will bring you *only* to the App Store. The device is smaller than I was expecting. I'm not a fan, but I'll use it awhile and see, since I'm keeping it for the sale price & Amazon Prime anyway. I already reset it once and was ready to abandon it until I watched the intro video. YOU MUST WATCH THE INTRO VIDEO. Hint:  \"Back\", with no button (there are no navigation buttons at all besides \"Home\"), is achieved by swiping up from the bottom. Which is also how you find your apps screen. Good luck with that (back-function works fine). Poorly designed, confusing lay-out. However the software seems to work okay with movies, messagin, etc. etc. Yes, you can use this with T-Mobile (no contract, I'm on it). My Samsung devices are so much easier, and more intuitive. I hope they add to this design's navigation, maybe enlarge it a little.",

This is totally against Amazon's mission statement, which is Client first. I say this as an Amazon fan. The team that developed Amazon Fire phone should be completely fired. They put Amazon BEFORE the CLIENT. It is a common mistake in big corporations, and I think Amazon's boss will notice it. They forgot the basics: \"develop a SOLID user-friendly phone with innovations\"; rather than a phone with many innovations, but not SOLID, and too many holes. How can a regular guy in NYC have a high-end phone and unable to access the NYTimes, Uber, GooglePlay or Google Maps?? But can use Firefly to buy products using Amazon.com. Can anyone explain this to me??? They got it wrong. It feels disrespectful. I will sadly return this product.",

So, I spent hours researching reviews and comments on the phone via Google, decided after reading the pros and cons of the phone to buy it yesterday, and found it had jumped $250 to $449 from its day-before price of $199 unlocked.  Wasted my time overall, and now I've learned not to trust the official Amazon iPad app for complete information on items for sale.  And here's the amusing kicker:  my Prime membership was to expire December 4th, so I had canceled my auto-renewal of it late-night December 3rd, anticipating my purchase of the phone on December 4th and getting the one-year Prime extension that came with it.  As of now I'm so frustrated I just left my Prime membership canceled, and would tell Mr. Bezos why if I could call/write him directly.  Arghhhh....tired of the Amazon price game, and now the fact I cannot trust the official Amazon app version for complete info on pricing to boot.

The phone is horrible and lets just accept it that it's not even worth hard earned 200USD. You're an insider, employee or a marketing executive...who ever you are...u've done a pretty impressive job here and the review details are even better than what Marques Brownlee does but sorry to say that won't help it a lot. If Amazon had a heart (and ofcourse brains) they would have not removed those earlier comments as changing the price doesn't make any difference. At the end of the day it's the same phone with the same crappy Kindle OS. Get one thing straight into the brains of people there in Amazon...whatever stick you have just boot pure Android into it and re-sell them for 399 and those backlogs won't lost many days. But ofcourse you guys won't do that since that will take your CORE amazon user away from your Amazon store. Free advice..take it or leave it....chaoo",
