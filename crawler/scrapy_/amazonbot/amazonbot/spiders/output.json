I paid less than $100 for a phone that can perform just as good as or even better than the name brand phones. I love the way its feels in hand, how loud it is, how responsive it is, everthing! I would say i have a minor problem with the keyboard's unresponsiveness (its the keyboard, NOT THE PHONE) . However i changed this problem by downloading a free app called \"a keyboard\". It allows you to choose either qwerty or a 3\u00d74 keyboard (which is my favorite) and you can choose backgrounds. Another thing i do not like is that the battery tends to die a little quick with playing games, watching movies, playing songs etc. and to solve this problem, i downloaded \"du battery\" app from the google play store. It tells me my battery's temperature, controls my battery power and creates a shortcut optimize button that i can press to stop background apps from killing my battery. The last thing i do not like is the screen resolution and viewing angles which seem to look a bit blurry looking from the sides of the screen. When watching movies or doing anything the screen has to be directly facing you for you to see clearly.

You can unlock your iPhone with it or purchase stuff online with just your finger print.  I know the s5 also has one but it is years behind and can only be set up with one finger where the iPhone you can set multiple fingers which makes it nice if you switch hands while using the phone.  Also you have to swipe to unlock the S5 which can take multiple times to do where is the iPhone really takes more than a half second touch and unlock.  The battery life for me was about the same as on the s5 although I did like the power saving mode on the s5 which iPhone does not have.  The charging time on the iPhone seems to be about half the time it took to charge the galaxy S5 though so it's nice to know if you can plug it in for a few minutes you can charge about a percent per minute where the s5 was about 1% every two minutes.

I've used Android and Windows phones as well. The pros are good build quality, nice display, good sound and call quality, decent battery life. But, IMO, you can get all this with an Android device at a fraction of the cost. Die hard Apple fans will be happy regardless. Windows phones are by far the best bang for the buck, but apps are still limited.  Several big annoyances for me with the Apple phone. You're stuck having to install and use iTunes to manage the phone such as to add music or ringtones. Even with the majority of 3rd party programs, iTunes still needs to be installed for them to work. If there is any bug or problem with iTunes, then you can have problems. I could not get music on my PC to sync with the phone whether using iTunes or a 3rd party program. The transfer would just fail without any warning. After more than 20 minutes on phone with Apple tech, who couldn't figure the problem out, I was disconnected and never got a call back. Ended up trouble shooting the problem myself and discovered the trouble was from the iTunes installation being on a \"locked drive\". Google \"repair security permissions for itunes for windows\" for the solution.  If you don't have unlimited data, and want to turn cellular data off, you may find your bluetooth voice commands won't work.  You'll need to turn Siri off for them to work, otherwise, you'll have to listen to Siri telling you to connect to the internet.  If you're a fan of Apple and don't care about price, or there is a business need to use Apple, buy this phone. If you want value for your money, have the freedom of choice, and to optimize for your personal use, then you have many more and better options elsewhere.

It allows you to choose either qwerty or a 3\u00d74 keyboard (which is my favorite) and you can choose backgrounds. Another thing i do not like is that the battery tends to die a little quick with playing games, watching movies, playing songs etc. and to solve this problem, i downloaded \"du battery\" app from the google play store. It tells me my battery's temperature, controls my battery power and creates a shortcut optimize button that i can press to stop background apps from killing my battery. The last thing i do not like is the screen resolution and viewing angles which seem to look a bit blurry looking from the sides of the screen.
